<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following pages are, practically, the result
of a course of lectures given, on the
Hyde foundation, at the Andover Theological
Seminary in the fall of 1902. Some of the chapters
were also used in lectures, delivered during the year,
at the Yale and Hartford Theological Seminaries and
at the Western Reserve University. Small portions
have appeared in Reviews and Magazines but have
been much changed in the transfer. The cordial
welcome accorded the lectures, including an expressed
desire that they be published, has led to
their appearance in this more permanent form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India should be better known to Europe and
America. I trust that the following pages may help
the student to understand the vast country and to
realise the greatness of the problems connected with
Christian work in the land; may they also stir
within many a strong desire to present Christ to that
great people, and inspire a hope in the ultimate and
speedy triumph of our cause in the land of the Vedas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I gratefully express my indebtedness to the Rev.
J. L. Barton, D. D., for his valuable suggestions and
kindly sympathy, and also to the Rev. W. P. Elwood
for his kind help in proofreading.

No country in the Orient is of greater interest
to the West today than is India. It is
picturesque in its life, wonderful in its history,
remarkable in its present conditions and fascinating
in its promise for the future.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a land most worthy of study both for what it
has been, for what it is and for what it is to become;
as the arena for the greatest conflict upon which our
Faith and Civilization have ever entered; and for their

Moreover, India is now peculiarly wedded to the
Anglo-Saxon race. For good or for evil the destiny
of that country, socially, politically, intellectually and
religiously, is linked with that of the Anglo-Saxon;
and we, as a part of the Anglo-Saxon race, cannot,
even if we would, shake off our connection with, and
responsibility for, it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a very extensive land. More a continent than
a country, it stretches, from east to west, a distance
of 1,900 miles; and it extends the same distance from
the Himalayas on the north to Cape Comorin on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
south. It covers an area equal to one-half of that of
the United States.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is physically divided into three portions. The
first, on the north, includes the Himalaya Mountains,
which separate it from the rest of Asia and which
furnish an important element in the meteorological
conditions of the country. Then from the base of
this mountain range extend the plains of the great
rivers which issue from the mountains themselves.
Again, from the southern boundaries of these plains
gradually rises a very extensive three-sided table-land
reaching towards the coast on both eastern and
western sides, and extending to Cape Comorin on
the south. There may be added to this the narrow
strips of coast-land on the east and west. In the
land are found some of the greatest and most wonderful
rivers in the world. The Ganges, which is
the queen of Indian rivers, carries life and fertility to
a population greater than that of the whole United
States. After a course of 1,557 miles it empties, into
the Bay of Bengal, 1,800,000 cubic feet of water per
second, which is half as much again as the water of
the Mississippi, and nearly six times as much as that
of the Nile at Cairo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a land wonderful in the variety of its climates.
It is difficult to imagine greater contrasts than those
existing between the various climates of India—from
the eternal snows in the north to the fierce and constant
heat of the tropics in the south; from the
practically rainless expanse of the western plains of
Sind to the 600 inches of rainfall which deluges the
eastern mountain slopes. No land is more extensively
cultivated and none gives more fruit in return
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for human labour than India. The Ganges, by the
abundant silt which it carries, brings fertility and
fruitfulness to its valleys. Even the plains of Sind,
which are nearly rainless, are transformed into life
by large irrigation schemes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rice, wheat and millets are the three staples of the
country. In the north, wheat furnishes sixty per
cent. of the cultivated area. This total area under
wheat cultivation in India is estimated to be equal to
that of all the wheat-fields of the United States. One-fourth
of the population of India lives on rice; and
various kinds of millets represent fifty-two per cent.
of the whole cultivation of the land. Though the
methods of cultivation there are primitive and the
implements used inadequate for best results, yet
through the rich climatic conditions and the persistent
efforts of the people the land normally yields an
abundance of good things for the support of its
inhabitants.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people of India number, according to the
census of 1901, 291,236,000—about one-fifth of the
inhabitants of the globe. This population represents
more races than are found in the whole of Europe.
Besides many small tribes, it has eleven nations,
the least of which numbers 2,250,000 souls. Of
these nations seven are of Aryan, and four of Dravidian,
extraction; and they differ in physique, temperament
and language. Between the sturdy Aryan
on the north and the degraded primitive people on
the plains of the south there is a great gulf. Between
the clever and subtle Baboo of Bengal and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
war-like Marahtta of the west, the bold, spirited
Pathan in the north and the passive but enduring
Dravidian in the south, there are many intermediate
classes which furnish wonderful diversity of character
and temperament. Among these people there is not,
and cannot at present be, a sense of oneness. Until recently
their whole civilization tended to emphasize their
divergence, to broaden the breach between them and
to cultivate a perpetual, mutual jealousy and hatred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The languages spoken by these people are, according
to the census of 1891, seventy in number.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
Of these the Sanskrit is the oldest, and may truly be
called the mother tongue of the country. It is one
of the most ancient languages in the world, with a
history of more than 3,000 years. It is strong, pliant,
expressive—a worthy vehicle of noble thought and
religious aspiration. Though not spoken today by
any tribe or people, it is not a dead language, for it is
the religious tongue of India. The best thought, the
deepest philosophy, the highest religious aspiration,
the laws, customs and legends of the people are
treasured in that tongue. All who would know the
religious life and thought of India at its best and in
its sources, should study Sanskrit. From it have
sprung many of the languages of Modern India. In
the northern and northwestern parts, the Aryan
tongues find supremacy. Although these languages
differ greatly among themselves, their source and
vocabulary is mainly Sanskrit. Of all Indian languages,
the one most widely spoken is the Hindi—88,000,000
people use it as their mother tongue.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Forty-one millions speak Bengali, 18,000,000 speak
Punjabi, 19,000,000, Marathi, 11,000,000 speak Gujurathi.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Dravidian languages of South India are entirely
separate from the Aryan group, their source and
character being Turanian. These languages are
Tamil, Telugu, Kanarese and Malayalam. Fifty-three
million people speak these tongues alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inhabitants of India are an ancient people.
When thirty centuries ago our ancestors were
grovelling in the lowest depths of primitive savagery,
our fellow-Aryans of India were enjoying a civilization
of their own, which was, in its way, unique
and distinguished. Their philosophy shows testimony
to their ancient glory. It may truly be said
that their chief glory is to be found more in ancient
than in modern times. It is a people whose progress
has, in some respects, been backward rather than
forward, and whose boast is rightly of what they
have been rather than of what they are.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a conservative people. India is a land where
custom is deified—the past is their glory. Today,
we are living, they say, in the iron age (Kali Yuga),
in which righteousness is all but lost. Hindu law
has conserved the past—it exalts past observances
above those of the present. Under such a system all
innovations are out of place, individual ambitions are
crushed. To resemble their ancestors is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum
bonum</span></span> of their life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inhabitants of that land are a rural people.
Unlike western countries, India has very few large
towns. Nine-tenths of the whole population live in
villages of less than 5,000, four-fifths live in villages of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under 1,000 inhabitants. The average village of India
today contains 363 inhabitants. During the last few
years the tendency has been towards towns. But
the large increase in the population is still to be seen
in rural regions. In India two-thirds of the villages
have less than 200 inhabitants each, while 1,000 have
from 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. Notwithstanding
this fact, the population, in some parts of the
country, is very dense. The whole of Bengal
furnishes 360 persons to the square mile, and in the
United Provinces of Agra and Oudh the total per
square mile rises to 416.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Owing to modern methods of sanitation, to peace
and to general prosperity, the population has grown
and is growing rapidly.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> There is already one person
to every two acres of land in the country; and under
the British Government the prosperity of India is
largely measured by the growth of the population;
and this in turn seriously increases the difficulty of
providing for the wants of the people. Indeed it has
become one of the hardest problems which confronts
the Indian government; and the difficulty is considerably
enhanced by the religion of the country
which demands that every man and woman marry
and add to the population, regardless of any question
as to health or even sanity. In India the first
privilege and duty of man and woman is supposed
to be the propagation of their kind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most marked characteristics of India is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its poverty. The people, as a whole, have always
been extremely poor. There has been some wealth
in the land; but it has not been evenly distributed.
While a few nabobs have enjoyed immense treasures,
the people, as a whole, have grovelled in the lowest
depth of penury and want. There is better distribution
of wealth today than ever before; and yet the
poverty of the masses continues to be a serious
feature of the land. <span class="tei tei-q">“Its finance lies at the base of
every difficulty connected with our Indian Empire,”</span>
is the remark of Sir Charles Dilke. And at the base
of the finance difficulty lies the poverty of the people.
It is a well known and lamentable fact that one-fifth
of the population, say sixty millions, are insufficiently
fed even in ordinary years of prosperity. They are
the ever ready prey of the first drought, distress or
famine that may happen. It is a not uncommon experience
of the ryot (or farmer) to retire at night
upon an empty stomach. The average income of
the common labourer in India is between four and
five rupees, or, say, $1.50 per month.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of this evil which the people endure is self-imposed.
They reveal a combination of blind improvidence,
reckless expenditure and an unwillingness
to shake off impoverishing customs. For
instance, the debt incurring propensity of the native
is akin to insanity. All the poor people with whom
I am acquainted are bound hand and foot by this
terrible mill-stone. And the interest paid upon loans
is crushing. Two and three per cent. per month is an
interest commonly received. It is rare that a poor
farmer who gets into the clutches of the money
lender regains his freedom. It usually leads to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
loss of all property and means of support. Under
the ancient Hindu law no money lender could recover
interest upon a loan beyond the amount of the
principal which he had advanced; under the present
rule he can recover to any extent, sell the tenant's
crops and even take possession of the land under a
judgment decree. It is one of those instances where
justice in law is made to minister unrighteousness
and cruelty in life. The people moreover are given
to the most extravagant expenses at marriages and
funerals. It is frequently the case that a man spends
upon the marriage of his son or daughter, the latter
especially, more than a whole year's income. I
know of many who are overwhelmed by debts incurred
for the marriage of their children; and the
saddest thing about it is that they have little option in
this expense; for it is prescribed by caste custom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Add to this the rank growth of religious mendicancy,
under the fostering care of religious teaching
and superstition. There are five and one-half millions
of such lazy, worthless fellows encumbering that
land today. The mass of them are sleek in body
and pestilential in morals. Whenever a man finds
work too hard, he dons the yellow cloth of the
religious mendicant and becomes an immediate
success. But alas for the community! Hindu
charity is proverbial, but it is blinder than love itself.
Such a body of worthless consumers would tax even
a wealthy land. To India it is a dreadful burden and
drain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Add to this the insane passion for jewels which
consumes both high and low. Millions of rupees'
worth of gold flows into the country annually, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most of it is melted and converted into personal
adornments for women and children. For this purpose
nearly one-half million goldsmiths, according
to the last census, are employed and make a comfortable
living at an annual expense of ten million
dollars. This is a much larger force of workmen than
that of all the blacksmiths in the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The litigious spirit of the people is also phenomenal.
It is doubtful if any other people on earth spend,
relative to their means, more in legal processes than
the Hindus. In view of all these facts, Sir W. W.
Hunter's statement that <span class="tei tei-q">“The permanent remedies
for the poverty of India rest with the people themselves”</span>
is eminently true. It is further emphasized
by the remarks of Sir Madhava Rao, K. C. S. I., one
of the very few statesmen whom India has produced
among her own children: <span class="tei tei-q">“The longer one lives,
observes and thinks,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the more deeply
does he feel there is no community on the face of the
earth which suffers less from political evils and more
from self-inflicted, self-accepted, or self-created, and
therefore avoidable, evils than the Hindu community.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Famine is an oft-recurring and most perplexing
evil with which India has always been familiar. In
times past, it was the gaunt Avenger which decimated
the people and which kept down the population
within the range of tolerable existence. The god of
dirt and insanitation carried away the unneeded residue
left by famine. Famine is one of the very few
evils before which human power stands helpless.
The government has done very much by irrigation
schemes and by the building of railways to mitigate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this evil. By famine funds and relief works it strives,
as it did the last famine, to reduce the mortality and
suffering arising from these seasons of drought. But
the constant penury of the people, and the fact of
their always living upon the verge of hunger and
want, make it almost impossible to save many from
the terrible result of such visitations. Perhaps there
is no other thing, at present, which occupies more of
the time and thought of the Imperial Government
than this; but, to drive entirely away this hideous
demon from a land which is peculiarly liable to
drought, and while the people are chronically unprepared
to meet the least extra drain, is more than can
be expected from any government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The railroads of the land are manifestations of the
material progress which meet one on all sides. In
the extent of its railroads India is the fifth country in
the world. Already the splendid railway system,
upon which travel is as comfortable as, and perhaps
cheaper than, in any other country in the world, has
extended 23,000 miles and reaches the remotest parts
of the land. These throbbing arteries carry life and
enterprise to all portions of India; and many regions
not yet made thus accessible will soon listen to the
neigh of the iron horse and feel the pulsations of
new life thereby. Three hundred million pounds
sterling have been expended in this work alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But better, if possible, than these roads is the rapidly
developing irrigation system which brings security
of life and works prosperity wherever it reaches.
Nearly 14,000,000 acres are now cultivated under this
system. This includes fourteen and eight-tenths per
cent. of all cultivated land in India. One great enterprise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this line is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Peryar Project”</span> of South
India which was large in its conception, perfect in
its execution and is rich in its blessings. It consists
in the diversion of a large river which vainly poured
its treasures down the western mountainside into the
Arabian Sea, and causing its waters to flow into the
eastern plains to fertilize the thirsty land as far as the
Bay of Bengal. It embraces the second largest dam
in the world, a tunnel one and one-fourth miles
through the mountain, and many miles of distributing
channels. It will irrigate at least 150,000 acres
for rice cultivation and will feed 400,000 people. I
live in the heart of the region thus fertilized and refreshed,
and know the joy of the residents who also
stand astonished before the magic power of these
white people who do for them what, they say, even
their gods failed to accomplish. It is well to remember
that these irrigation schemes, now found in India,
are much the most extensive in any country.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking at her commerce during the Victorian
reign alone, we see a growth of 1,000 per cent. in
the imports and exports of India. The export of tea
has risen from nothing to 70,000 tons, and that of
cotton from nothing to 220,000 tons. There are now
in the land 150 cotton-mills with 150,000 labourers.
Three million tons of coal are annually mined, and
gold mines yield £1,000,000 sterling every year. It
may, indeed, be said that India has now, for the first
time in its history, taken a place as a land of manufactures,
trade and commerce.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and that of the West is marked. Problems that today
stir this land to its depth have no existence in
India. The conservatism of India is proverbial. The
Hindu people have been kept back from all progress,
so that questions arising about human rights and
liberty have not begun to be mooted there. The
thousand problems of our land are the direct result of
the emphasis which our civilization has given to
human rights and individual freedom and the equality
of men. India has thus far denied to the individual
those rights and liberties which are deemed
elementary and fundamental in the West. Its emphasis
has always been upon the rights and privileges
of Society as a corporate body. It has ignored entirely
the claims of the individual and has prevented
him from enjoying his inalienable rights in any division
of society. This may be seen in the two great
departments of life in that land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The family systems of the East and of the West
are essentially different. In India the Joint Family
System prevails. According to this system members
of a family for three generations live together and
have all things in common. No member of the
family can claim anything as his own. It is the old
patriarchal system and emphasizes the rights of the
family as a whole, and denies to any individual member
separate possession or privileges. This system
has had a long day in India; but, as western ideas
are spreading, dissatisfaction is manifestly increasing,
especially among the educated classes. The recent
introduction to the Madras Legislature of the so-called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gains of Learning Bill”</span> is the first serious
attack made upon that system. By means of this
bill, which was introduced by an orthodox Hindu,
but which is not yet passed, an educated man could
claim exclusive right to ownership of all properties
acquired by him through his education. Thus, for
the first time in India an individual might claim,
apart from the family, that wealth which was acquired
by himself. This bill has brought opposition
from the public, because it conflicts with the rights of
the joint family, and is a serious blow to all the old
Hindu family privileges. The Hindu joint family
system, while it has been a source of some blessing
to the land, has also been a serious curse in that it
has fostered laziness, dissension and improvidence,
and has put a ban upon individual initiative and
ambition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Child marriages have been an unfailing source of
evil to the land. Of this Sir John Strachey says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“It would be difficult to imagine anything more
abominable than the frequent consequences of child
marriages by which multitudes of girls of ten to
twelve or less are given over to outrage; or, if they
belong to the higher class of Hindus, are doomed to
lives of degraded widowhood.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Indian government has endeavoured to remove
this evil; but at all points it has been opposed not
only by conservative, orthodox Hindus, but also by
educated members of the community. No system
can degrade the womanhood of a race, nor, indeed,
for that matter, its manhood, more than that which
marries its girls in childhood and which consigns
millions of them to wretched widowhood. One of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the consequences is that girls of even twelve years
are known to become mothers in that land, while
very few attain the age of eighteen without bearing
children. An increasing population under these
physical conditions cannot be a healthy or a vigorous
one.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India, Society is almost exclusively the product
of the ancient caste system. A more elaborate social
system than this was never known in the world. It
is an order of social tyranny of the worst sort,
whereby every man is compelled to give up his own
individuality and to be bound to the iron will of an
ignorant community: a will also which is based upon
the past and conforms to the rules and habits of peoples
who lived in remote antiquity. No greater millstone
could be hung around the neck of any people
than that of the multitudinous caste rules of Manu
and later accretions which are the all in all of Hindu
life. There may have been good in this system in
the past, and it may have conserved some blessings
of antiquity; but today it is the worst tyranny and
the greatest curse that has blasted the life of the people.
It is the source of their physical degeneracy, for
it compels them to marry within narrow lines of
consanguinity. It has cursed the people with a narrow
sympathy; for no man in that system deems it
his duty to bless or help those beyond his own caste.
It has sown poverty broadcast over the land; for it
prohibits a man from engaging in any work or trade
which is not prescribed by caste rules and customs;
and thus has brought many to penury, want and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
famine. When the caste-prescribed occupation or
work is not available, the suffering is very great.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has brought stagnation to the people by restraining
every man who had ambition to move forward
and improve his prospects in life. The whole village
regards as conceited a young man of the outcastes
who seeks to rise in life; they soon bring him low.
Progress is impossible under the caste system.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner, it has fostered the pride and presumption
of one class and destroyed the ambition
and aspiration of the other. No people on earth today
are more proud than the Brahmans; none more
hopelessly abject than the Pariahs and other outcastes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has also made national unity and the spirit of
fellowship impossible in the land; large corporate interests
are impossible for the people. The castes of
the community are filled with jealousy and are mutually
antagonistic; each division having rules and
ceremonies which make it impossible for communion
of interests with others. Many would like to see it
removed; but the system itself has created such abjectness
of feeling among them that they dare not
come forward to stem its tide or oppose it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ignorance still rests like a pall upon that land.
According to the census of 1891, out of a total population
of 261,840,000, 133,370,000 were males. Of
these, 118,819,000 were analphabet. Including boys
under instruction, only 14,550,000 could read and
write. Of the 128,470,000 females only 740,000
could read and write or were being instructed. In
other words, only eleven per cent. of the males and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a little more than one-half of one per cent. of the
females were in any sense literate. In Madras, we
find the greatest progress; but even there eighty-five
per cent. of the male and ninety-nine per cent. of the
female population are illiterate. In Oudh, on the
other hand, corresponding figures are ninety-four and
very nearly one hundred per cent. When it is remembered
that the Brahmans, who constitute only
five per cent. of the total population, include seventeen
per cent. of the literate class and more than
twenty per cent. of those who know English, it can
be understood that the illiteracy of the common
people is still greater than that indicated by the
above figures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considerable effort has been made by the government
to educate this immense population. It is
seriously handicapped in this endeavour by want of
funds. The State does not largely enter into the establishing
of schools of its own; its policy being to
give grants in aid to private bodies on the basis of
results achieved. And it contents itself with the establishing
and conducting of relatively only a few
schools of its own which shall serve as models and
as a stimulus to the private aided institutions. More
than three-fourths of the education of the land is thus
conducted by private bodies which are encouraged
by the government through its grants in aid. There
still remain not a few indigenous or, so-called,
<span class="tei tei-q">“piall”</span> schools. Educationally, these schools are of
little value, as their training is both antiquated in
kind and extremely limited in quantity. They are
interesting because they reveal to us the old educational
methods of the land. Schools on modern
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lines, however, by coming under government surveillance,
for the purpose of receiving grants in aid,
are conducted much more efficiently, and attain results
worthy to be compared with those of western
lands. The chief feature of the educational system,
controlled, examined and aided by government, is the
emphasis given to an English training. From the
second year of instruction, the English language
grows annually in importance in the curriculum of
studies. In the grammar school it becomes compulsory
and in the high school and college it is the
sole medium of the communication of knowledge.
The English language is emphasized also because it is
the test for admission even into many of the lowest
of the numberless offices in connection with government
service; so that the study of this language of
the West has become to young India practically a
necessity and a craze. People of the lowest conditions
in life pawn and mortgage their property and
involve themselves in terrible debts for the sake of
giving their sons an English education.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christian missions constitute one of the principal
bodies which engage in the training of Hindu youth.
One-ninth of all the school children of India are
found in mission schools. This number includes
330,000 boys and nearly 100,000 girls. In the training
of girls, Protestant missions have not only been
pioneers; they are also today much the most prominent
and efficient educators of the women of the
land. Their girls' schools and colleges are not only
the most numerous, but also the most efficiently conducted
and thoroughly managed of all institutions
for women in India. The Madras Christian College
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for boys and the Sarah Tucker Woman's College of
Tinnevelly are among the best institutions for those
classes in India. The educational system of India
culminates in the five Universities of Calcutta, Bombay,
Madras, Allahabad and Lahore. These are not
instructing, but simply examining universities like
the University of London. With these the 140 colleges
of two grades and of various degrees of efficiency,
are affiliated. In these colleges are found
18,000 students of whom more than 5,000 graduate
yearly. The city of Calcutta is a city of many colleges
and has more college students, relative to its
population, than almost any city of the West.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though the masses of the people, and especially
the women, are still, as we have seen, grossly ignorant,
yet every year encouraging progress is being
made in spreading the blessings of, and in creating a
taste for, education. Every year natives themselves
enter more largely into the educational work and find
in it not only a living, but noble scope for their
activities. Among the higher and cultured classes
there is a growing body of young men, besides the
ambitious few from the lower classes, crowding into
the higher institutions of the land. It is one of the
problems of the day to direct the mind of this
increasing army of university graduates to other
professions than the overcrowded government service.
There is a persistent feeling among these youth
that it is the business of State to supply them with
lucrative posts upon their graduation. And it is the
disappointed element of this class which furnishes so
many of the discontented, blatant demagogues who
are almost a menace to the land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet this educational work is one of the potent,
leavening influences of the country, and is helping
greatly in carrying quietly forward one of the
mightiest revolutions that have been witnessed in
any land. In its train follows closely the social
elevation of the people. The relaxation of the
terrible caste system, the elevation of woman and
her redemption from some of the cruelties and
injustice of the past, immediately attend that expanding
knowledge which results from the schools
of the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Protestant missions are preëminent in their work
of educating the Christian communities gathered together
by them.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Though these communities are
largely drawn from the lowest outcasts, yet they
compare favourably, in their educational equipment,
with the highest classes. This is a significant indication
of their present, and a bright promise for their
future, position among the people of India.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">6. The Political Situation.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India today is politically a subject country.
Though in one sense England did not directly subjugate
India, it is nevertheless true that its inhabitants,
though treated with large consideration, are
today a subject people—ruled by a foreign nation
7,000 miles away. Hence, it might be expected that
political rights and privileges would not prevail there
as among a self-governing, entirely independent,
people. The existence of an army of about 75,000
Britons in that land today is significant of the situation
and partly reveals one grip with which Great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Britain holds India and makes it a part of her great
empire. I do not wish to minimize the moral power
with which also, and increasingly, Great Britain
draws India by sweet compulsion to herself; of this
I shall speak later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should also be remembered that the genius of the
Orient is not for self-government; in the East, people
have little taste for free institutions; they have always
craved, and found their greatest happiness and chief
welfare in, a strong paternal government. The ordinary
Hindu seeks for himself nothing higher than a
government which, while not asking for his opinion
concerning its policy and acts, will at least dispense
a fair modicum of justice to him and his.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding all this, the Indian government
has bestowed upon the people a wonderfully large
meed of power and privilege. Political progress in
the land is one of the marvels of the past century.
Before the British entered India that land had never
enjoyed the first taste of representative institutions.
Today the query which arises in the mind of disinterested
persons who know and love India is,
whether political rights and liberties have not, of late
years, been conferred too rapidly upon them. It
should not be expected that a people who, by instinct
and unbroken heritage, are the children of the
worst kind of autocratic and absolute government,
should acquire, in one age or century, wisdom or
aptitude to rule themselves. The mass of Hindus
love to be led and they follow easily.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a small and growing party of the soil
who have aptly learned many of the lessons taught
them by the rulers. The best acquired of all these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lessons is that of the power of agitation and of the
efficacy among the Anglo-Saxon race of the cry for
human rights. The only difficulty is that one might
suppose, from the language of some of these men
that England has not yet conceded to worthy Indians
any of those political privileges which every Anglo-Saxon
citizen demands for himself. As a matter of
fact, we see in the municipalities of that land a form
of popular government such as even not all western
countries enjoy. The power of the franchise, in the
election of municipal commissioners, is vested in all
those who are possessed of the least amount of
property. Even women enjoy the franchise; and it
is a curious fact that the natives of South India have
recently protested in the newspapers against the
granting of this power to women, because, they say,
the power is exercised only by <span class="tei tei-q">“dancing girls”</span> and
other public characters. To those who watch carefully
the working of this right of municipal franchise
and see how easily and speedily the natives have
adopted all the vices and tricks of the system, it does
not by any means seem an unmixed good. And the
hardest critics of the system that I have met have
been intelligent and loyal Indians who believe that
this meed of self-government is fraught with evil.
The District Boards also are composed almost entirely
of native gentlemen, and they have large powers in
the administration of the internal affairs of the land.
Moreover these municipal and local bodies, together,
elect members for provincial legislative bodies where
they enjoy recently enlarged powers for interpellating
the government—a power which, by excessive use or
abuse, they may soon forfeit.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To all this must be added the freedom of the press,
which also has recently been abused by the dissemination
of disloyal and seditious sentiments, but which
adds immensely to the powers of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the <span class="tei tei-q">“National Congress”</span> is a peculiar institution
which, while it gives scope to the political aspirations
of many natives, adds, by its very existence,
to the lustre of the British Raj in the land. Just imagine
for a moment the existence of such a Congress
under Russian rule! It is true that this Congress,
which meets annually in some great city of the land,
has no connection with government or legislative
bodies and has only that power and influence which
inhere in its deliberations and resolutions. It is also
true that up to the present it has given itself largely
to the criticism and abuse of government. By this
it has alienated some of its best friends. Still, even
as a public censor it has doubtless done good, and
offers to the discontented a wholesome vent for pent
up feelings. It is also a remarkable gathering in its
numbers of cultured men and illustrates one of the
wonders which Great Britain has accomplished in
that land. To think, that out of the babel of Indian
tongues there should gather together in one place
annually some 5,000 native gentlemen to discuss
questions of State, and to criticise one of the most
modern of governments in the pure English accents
of Addison or of Macaulay! What a wonderful object
lesson of progress this!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor is Great Britain as remiss or as selfish as many
would lead us to believe in the distribution of the
loaves of office. There are only 122,661 male Britishers
in that land (including the army)—one to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every 2,500 of the population. Of these, only 750
are found in the higher offices of government.
In the Provincial Services 2,449 natives are employed
in high judicial and administrative posts. It is a significant
fact that out of 114,150 appointments, carrying
Rs.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> 1,000 annually, ninety-seven per cent, are in
the hands of natives. To all offices, below that of the
Governor of the Province, natives are eligible. As
Judges of the High Court and as Members of the
legislative bodies not a few Indians are found; as
they are also in the Indian Civil Service which was so
long exclusively filled by Anglo-Indians. It hardly
appears how England can hold that great land to herself,
as a member of her empire, with fewer of her
own citizens than are now found at the helm. Nor
does it yet appear that a strong, efficient and acceptable
government can be maintained there by a
large reduction of this force. I use the word <span class="tei tei-q">“acceptable”</span>
advisedly; and it is certainly the business
of Great Britain to discover and consult the wishes
of the people—not of the hungry office seekers—in
this matter. After many years of observation and of
living among the people, I am convinced that nine-tenths
of them are prepared any day to vote in favour
of the relative increase, and not the decrease, of the
European official force. The people have found them
to be just and honest; they know that they can be
depended upon to administer justice with an even
hand and that they are incorruptible. In their own
native officials they have no confidence. They have
found, alas, too often that justice is sold by them to
the highest bidder. The <span class="tei tei-q">“middle men”</span> who arrange
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such matters are too commonly known as the
accompaniments of the native courts of justice. It is
true that some native judges are above such venality.
But I know how general is the want of native confidence
in native officials. Many a time have I been
importuned to use my influence to have cases transferred
from the jurisdiction of the native to the Englishman.
And the reason invariably given is that
<span class="tei tei-q">“The white man will not accept bribes and will give
justice.”</span> Indeed, it may be said that the chief difficulty
which confronts the Government in its great
work is that of saving the people from low, mercenary
and unprincipled native officials—especially
those of the lower and lowest grades.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The police department is corrupt to the core. The
common people dread the policeman as they do the
highwayman; for the constable rarely touches a case
without making money out of the transaction; and
he is expert in manufacturing cases.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What India needs today, above all else, is an
honest, faithful, efficient class of officials. The
presence of a few English dignitaries found there is
worth ten times its cost to the land, purifying and
toning up the service.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering the political situation as a whole, I
confidently maintain that the people of India enjoy
political rights and privileges quite as extensively as
they are prepared wisely to exercise them. No
people anywhere enjoy larger privileges, relative to
their ability to use them wisely; and no subject
people on earth have ever been treated with larger
consideration by their conquerors, or have been more
faithfully trained to enter upon an ever increasing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sphere of opportunity and of self-government. The
political situation in India today—in the privileges
and rights which the people enjoy—is a marvellous
testimony to the wisdom and unselfishness of Great
Britain in her Indian rule.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The government of India is perhaps the most
elaborate in the world; the highest powers of statesmanship
have been manifested by the successive
rulers during more than a century in the development
of a State which is extraordinary no less in the
complication of its provisions and details than in the
wise adaptation of human laws to meet the multitudinous
exigencies of this great conglomeration of
peoples. It should also be remembered that British
statesmen in their work of legislation in India, and
in their coordination of laws, have not only had to
consider the manifold character of the different portions
of the population of the land; what is more difficult
still, they have been compelled to ingratiate themselves
with the Indians by conserving, so far as possible,
those myriads of ancient laws and customs
which obtain there. The laws of Manu and of other
writers of twenty-five centuries ago have been handed
down by this people through the ages and have accumulated
authority and reverence with increasing
time, until today all Hindus regard them as divinely
given and as possessing irresistible claim upon them
for all time. So that, while it may be said on the one
hand that the laws of India are largely built upon western
foundations, and savour of Christian principles and
modern ideas; it should also be remembered, on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other hand, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dicta</span></span> of ancient Hindu lawgivers
find a large place in the legal codes of that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yea, even more than this is true. There are a host
of caste rules and customs which have no further
sanction than the fact that they have become customs,
and yet which have been dignified with the
authority of law. This is of course due chiefly to
the fact that most customs in India have a religious
basis and interpretation, and therefore draw to themselves
that sanctity and claim which belong to things
religious. Thus, for instance, every caste in South
India has its own marriage customs. Most of these
are highly incongruous with modern ideas and rights,
and most of them absolutely disregard the rights of
the wife. And yet it has been deemed wise by the
State to conserve and to give the sanction of law to
these multitudinous marriage customs which are
enough in themselves to constitute an extensive
code.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some conception of the magnitude of the work
carried on by the Indian Government may be gathered
from the following description by Bishop Thoburn:—<span class="tei tei-q">“With
a population greater than that of the
five great powers of Europe put together; with a
revenue exceeding $350,000,000; with a foreign
commerce worth $768,000,000 annually; with a
standing army 230,000 strong, more than two-thirds
of which are composed of native soldiers; with a
drilled police force of more than 150,000 men; with
a code of laws in many respects superior to those
found on the statute books of European countries;
and with courts of justice as impartial and as faithfully
conducted as any to be found in the world,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
India may well claim a place among the great empires
of the present era.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The British Government has respected the possessions
of native chiefs in whose hands still remain
about one-third of the country. But these so called
native territories are so largely under English control
and guidance that we may well regard them as
essentially a part of the British Domain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Secretary of State for India has practically the
control of British Indian affairs. He, with his council
in London, has the final word in Indian matters
of paramount importance. Nevertheless, the Indian
Government finds this power rarely antagonistic in
matters whereon it has firmly made up its mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The British possessions in India are distributed into
twelve governments, each separately organized and
yet all of them constituting parts of the Supreme
Government of India. This Supreme Government is
administered by a Governor-General or Viceroy with
whom is associated a Council of six members. This
Council constitutes the Viceroy's Cabinet and each
one has charge of a separate department of the government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the Provincial Governments of India, the principal
ones are the Province of Bengal with 71,000,000,
under a Lieutenant-Governor; United Provinces
of Agra and Oudh, with a population of 47,000,000,
under a Lieutenant-Governor; Presidency of Madras,
with 35,500,000, under a Governor; Presidency of
Bombay, with 18,800,000, under a Governor; and the
province of Punjab, with 20,800,000, under a Lieutenant-Governor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The unit of government in India is the District.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The whole of India is divided into 235 Districts. At
the head of a District is placed an officer known as
Collector, Senior Magistrate, or Deputy Commissioner,
who is practically ruler of that division. He is the
administrative representative of the government. In
each District there is also a District Judge and a few
other officers at the head of various departments.
These Districts vary in size and population, covering
areas from 14,000 to 1,000 square miles, and containing
from 3,000,000 to 250,000 population. The
average population of a District is 800,000. Nothing
impresses the careful observer more than the large
amount of responsibility and the multifarious duties
which devolve upon these District officers. During
recent years, however, authority has been withheld
increasingly from Collectors and centralized in the
Provincial Governments; for at the head of every
Province also there is a government patterned somewhat
after the Supreme Government in Calcutta.

No greater mistake can be made than to think that
India is either crudely or poorly governed. Owing to
the great poverty of the land it is extremely difficult to
maintain so costly and elaborate a régime as the
present one; and many claim that for the support of
so expensive a luxury the people are taxed beyond
their ability and resources. The taxation imposed
by a government on its people is rightly considered,
both in its extent and character, as a measure of the
wisdom of the State. The critics of the Indian government
are prone to dwell upon the alleged injustice
of its taxes. It is, however, difficult to understand
why this matter should be pressed unless it be on the
ground, apparently maintained, that the poverty of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the people should exempt them from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> of the
burdens of taxation—a theory beautifully generous
to the people but fatal to the maintenance of any
government. The salt tax does certainly seem cruel
in its severe pressure upon the very poor; and
yet it is the only one whereby this very large
part of the community can be reached at all, and
made to contribute its mite to the State which protects
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Comparing present taxes with those of the past,
we should certainly expect heavier imposts now, because
the government furnishes today, as an equivalent
of protection and blessing, infinitely more than
former dynasties did. And yet Sir W. Hunter has ably
shown from a comparison of taxes levied by the present
government and by the Moghul government that
the modern Hindu is vastly better off than was his
ancestor of two and three centuries ago. Today, five
and one half per cent. is collected in land tax; under
the Moghul rule they had to pay from thirty-three
per cent. to fifty per cent. Besides this, the Mohammedan
imposed various other taxes, many of them
upon non-Mohammedans as a religious penalty.
Nor were the Hindu governments one whit better
off; and even today the native states are much

The famine commission is the highest authority on
the subject. In its exhaustive report of 1880 it
writes:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the majority of native governments the
revenue officer takes all he can get, and would take
treble the revenue we should, if he were strong
enough to exact it.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we pursue the comparison to that of European
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
peoples, Indian taxation would seem but a trifle.
Placing even English taxes side by side with India's,
we shall find instruction. The average income in the
United Kingdom is £40, while the tax assessed is
44<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>, or five and one-half per cent. In India, alas, the
average income is only 36<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>. But then the tax is only
1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>, 9<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>
per capita which is a trifle smaller per capita
than that for England. Here again we are impressed
with the reasonableness of the tax imposed.

The opium and liquor traffic in India is one which
has drawn forth much criticism. From the moral
standpoint the critics have a very strong case. The
evil which the opium traffic of India has inflicted
upon China—against her will too—has been enormous.
The large army of opium eaters which it has
created, only to destroy with a terrible death, has
long been an argument to which no nation of England's
position and pretensions can render satisfactory
reply.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner, the State monopoly of the drink
traffic is neither honourable nor wise. It not only
gives unwonted and unwarrantable dignity to a disreputable
business, it also involves the State in the
business of making a large army of drunkards in the
land. To take up a traffic like this, for the revenue
there is in it, is to trifle with the higher interests of
the subjects and to become instrumental in the corruption
and misery of the people whom it is bound
to protect. It is questionable whether any other
civilized government has involved itself in such unworthy
means of creating a revenue. Doubtless,
opium and drink represent, morally, the weakest part
of this government. Of course, the all important
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
defense lies in the revenue thus acquired. These two
items of revenue flow more easily than any others
into the depleted treasury of State. To give these
up in behalf of what is termed sentiment, would
necessitate the imposition of other heavy taxes.
This is an aspect of the question which too easily
silences and secures the acquiescence of the people
of India. But, its evil is great and is spreading.

The drink curse is rapidly becoming one of the
trying problems of India. It was slanderously remarked
some years ago that if the English then left
that country the only monuments left behind of their
life would have been broken whiskey bottles! There
is indeed ground today for the fear that if England
were to abandon the land, it would leave, as the
saddest monument of its past, an immensely increasing
army of drinkers; and this evil is further enhanced
by the mean ideal of life which the ordinary
Englishman sets before Hindus by his passion for the
cup. Half a century ago an Englishman died while
on duty in the jungles in South India, and his body
was there buried in the wilderness. The natives
soon erected a shrine over his grave and, for a long
time, offered, in true sobriety, whiskey and cheroots
to appease his thirsty and unsatisfied spirit! It is not
strange that the natives should recognize a continuity
of spirit-taste in the here and the hereafter of the
Sahib!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The recent utterance of the Archbishop of Canterbury
on this subject should be heeded by the State.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The true principle of morals,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is to have
nothing whatever to do with that which is shown to
be necessarily productive of evil. The English nation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
caused the opium evil in China and we are responsible
for that evil. I also protest against the
principle of raising revenue by temptations to evil.
It might be right for a government to pause before
interfering with private trade; but, in this case we
ourselves are carrying on the evil trade. Such a
thing on the part of a great government is, I think,
without a parallel in the whole world.”</span>

The Army in India is a necessary but great evil
in the expense which it involves to the government,
no less than in the evil life which it leads among, and
the evil example which it sets, the native community.
Its influence is deplorable. It is the most vulnerable
to attack of all departments of government, both on
the score of expense and character. <span class="tei tei-q">“Tommy Atkins”</span>
is the greatest trial to the Hindu, and brutally
rides rough-shod over all his sensibilities. If he
could only be left at home with safety to British
interests in the land, it would help largely to improve
the situation between the two races. It would also
save England from the terrible disgrace of immorality
which the army is instrumental in carrying as a
plague wherever it goes. Awful indeed is the prevalence
of the social vice in the native community itself;
but the English Army spreads the demoralization in
a most disgraceful way.

Considering the government as a whole, then, it is
wonderful, both in the extent of its operation and in
its numberless activities and agencies. Its purpose
is generally noble, and its wisdom, both in the
framing of laws and in general administration, has
been most marked. The occasion of most of its
failings and weaknesses is the poverty of the people

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The British people are only today beginning to
realize fully the wonderful mission which, under
God's providence, they are called to fulfill in that
great land of the Vedas. For nearly a century the
commercial motive was not only paramount but was
practically the only motive which impelled the
Anglo-Saxon in his contact with India. Everything
Indian had value in his eyes in proportion as it added
to his revenues. For many years he excluded the
Missionary of the Cross from his domains in the
East, lest that good man should, by teaching the
people, disturb the revenue of the Honourable East
India Company. As the domains of this great
company extended and its powers multiplied, the
English nation gradually came to realize their own
responsibility as a people to the land; and the Indians
thus were brought within their influence. This contact
and communion of interests became to them the
voice of responsibility and of obligation to impart
their blessings to them as well as to take their material
resources from them. The dawn of the new
altruistic sense towards its subject people, though
long deferred, rapidly grew into full daylight; and
Great Britain today feels, as no country has felt before,
its privilege and duty to bestow upon its dependency
in the East the highest and best which it
can furnish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The difficulty of England's mission in India is
greatly enhanced by the difference which amounts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
almost to a contrast between her own people and the
inhabitants of India. The striking difference of type
and character existing between the Anglo-Saxon and
the Hindu facilitates all sorts of misunderstanding
between them, and aids perceptibly in making the
path of the British Raj a very thorny one in the land.
It would perhaps be impossible to find two peoples
who are farther removed from each other in temperament
and training—whose nature and antecedents
are more irreconcilable at all points. While the
Anglo-Indian is bold, frank and just, even to harshness,
the Hindu is subtle, affable, practiced to dissimulation,
with ready susceptibilities to temporize
and to barter justice for expediency. On the one
side, we see the Westerner haughty, unyielding and
unwilling to conciliate; on the other we behold the
Oriental willing to be trampled upon when it seems
necessary, and to smile with apparent gratitude under
the process; but, withal, possessed of a large inheritance
of ineradicable prejudices, which make a
contact with his too domineering Western lord an
unceasing trial to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another point at which the two races are
antipodal. The Briton is progressive to the core.
He only needs to be assured that a certain course is
right and for the best interests of the community, in
order to adopt it. His face ever looks upward and
his ambition is ever to go forward. But, in India he
lives among a race whose chief divinity is custom
and the gist of whose decalogue is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold fast to
the past.”</span> As they approach a proposed enterprise
their first and last question concerning it is not
whether it is right and best, but whether it is in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
line with the past and would be approved by their ancestors.
The whole country has been anchored for the
last twenty-five centuries to a code of social laws and
customs which are more unyielding than the laws of
the Medes and Persians. With them conservatism is
the acme of piety and propriety. All progress has
been practically forced upon the country from without,
and in the teeth of their most sacred institutions
and their most earnest protestation and opposition.
Thus the great difference between the two peoples
has been a serious hindrance to the realization of
British designs in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding all this, Great Britain has patiently,
persistently and doggedly carried on her
work and pursued her highest ideals for India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And what have been the ideals and blessings which
she is seeking to achieve for that great land?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first is that of Western culture and civilization.
In these two particulars, England has introduced
into India a perpetual conflict. Western ideas,
processes of thought, points of aspect and ideals of
beauty and of life have been gradually supplanting
the very different ones of the East. Western life in
India today is a constant challenge to the people to
study, admire and appropriate its many features of
thought and conduct; and India is not insensible to
this call. The railroads and hospitals, the schools
and sanitary projects which have been introduced by
the West into that land are markedly transforming
the sentiment and the life of the people. The contrast
between the people of India today and of a
century ago is all but complete in this respect.
While the educational institutions of the land are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
revolutionizing the thought, the more material elements
of civilization are transforming the outer life
of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
England also is imparting to India the Anglo-Saxon
conception of right, of law and of justice. In order
to know how widely apart the East and West were
in this respect, one should live in India a few years.
The idea of equal rights to all the people, of freedom
of speech, of liberty of conscience and of other similar
rights which are regarded as elementary and
fundamental in the West, was all but foreign to
India when England established her power there.
That the government itself should treat high and low,
the poor ryot and the wealthy rajah, the ignorant
Pariah and the cultured Brahman as one in their
claim for right and protection, for justice and for
favour, seemed to the Hindu absurd. It is one of the
best commentaries on British justice and administration
in India, that the people have now come not
only to regard it with satisfaction, but also as an indispensable
condition of their life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blessings of peace also are among the greatest
which England has conferred upon India. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pax
Britanica”</span> is equally known and loved today in
India and in the British Isles. From time immemorial
India had been torn asunder, not only by internecine
wars, but also by numerous attacks from
the peoples of other countries. India has always
been a prey both to the decimating wars of her own
unjust and ambitious tyrants, and mutually antagonistic
castes and tribes; she has also been the easy
victim of any hardy, enlightened, ambitious people
who sought to invade her. The presence of Great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Britain in India has been a voice commanding peace
to its troubled and exhausted people. With a strong
hand she has put down injustice of tribe against
tribe and made impossible inter-tribal wars and raids.
She has brought rest such as India never before enjoyed
and has given safety to the most harmless and
innocent classes, as she has peace to the most warlike
and aggressive in the land. This great land of
the East has thus had opportunities to grow and to
develop in many of the most essential characteristics
of individual and national progress. These blessings
would have been impossible apart from the peace
which Great Britain assured and wrought out for the
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In connection with this we need to emphasize the
various forms of progress which are an essential
part of British blessing to India. We have seen that
India was a stagnant land, that its people were preëminently
unprogressive and ultra-conservative.
England has helped her to break down many of
these barriers of the past. Though India is obstinately
slow in her acceptance of the spirit and blessings
of progress, England has thrust upon her many
of the conditions, and compelled her to enter into
some of the paths of progress which will bring inestimable
benefits into her life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner, the mission of England has been
and is a religious one. Her Majesty, Queen Victoria,
upon assuming authority in the land, issued a proclamation
to the effect that under her reign all the inhabitants
of India should enjoy perfect right to
worship as they please and whom they please. It is
true that too many of the representatives of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
British Government in India today are so impressed
with the importance of a government that is absolutely
neutral in religious matters, that they have both
ceased themselves to manifest any religious preference
in their life and are scrupulously careful to see
to it that Christians get just a little less of right and
of protection than the adherents of other faiths.
This they consider to be true altruism added to
breadth of religious sentiment!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding this, nothing is more manifest in
India today than that the very fact of the rulers of
the land being nominally Christians adds to the
prestige of Christianity in the land. The people
naturally come to regard it as the State religion.
What is more significant, however, is the fact that,
at the basis of modern laws in that land and of the
multiplying institutions of the country, distinctively
Christian principles are universally recognized.
Should the government of India resolve to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em>
neutral in all religious matters, it would have
to renounce those laws and institutions which have
furnished it with all its success in the land and which
today crown its efforts with largest usefulness. To
the government, and unconsciously to the masses of
the people, Christian thought and truth and method
necessarily characterize most of the laws, institutions
and processes of India. They are all a part of the
work of Great Britain in that land and such a part as
she could not dispense with if she would. It is a
part of her unconscious Christian heritage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the work of Great Britain in India has been
attended with a large degree of success; it has lifted
the land out of a condition of semi-savagery and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
placed it among the civilized nations of the world.
It has cut it asunder from its anchorage to the past
and brought it almost abreast of the times. There is
still much to be done and much to be desired. We
shall be glad to see the day when radical steps in
progress shall be taken voluntarily by the people and
through the initiative of their own leaders, rather
than that they should wait to have them thrust upon
them, as in the past, by the progressiveness of the
foreigner among them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people, on the whole, appreciate the blessings
of British supremacy in the land. If they are not
demonstratively loyal to the government, they certainly
do rest satisfied in the progress which has been
achieved for them.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Our allegiance to the British rule,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
based upon the highest considerations of practical
expediency. As a representative of the educated
community of India—and I am entitled to speak on
their behalf and in their name,—I may say that we
regard British rule in India as a dispensation of Divine
Providence. England is here for the highest and the
noblest purposes of history. She is here to rejuvenate
an ancient people, to infuse into them the
vigour, the virility and the robustness of the West,
and so pay off the long-standing debt, accumulating
since the morning of the world, which the West
owes to the East. We are anxious for the permanence
of British rule in India, not only as a guarantee
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for stability and order, but because with it are bound
up the best prospects of our political advancement.
To the English people has been entrusted in the
Councils of Providence the high function of teaching
the nations of the earth the great lesson of constitutional
liberty, of securing the ends of stable government,
largely tempered by popular freedom. This
glorious work has been nobly begun in India. It has
been resolutely carried on by a succession of illustrious
Anglo-Indian statesmen whose names are enshrined
in our grateful recollections. Marvellous as
have been the industrial achievements of the Victorian
era in India, they sink into insignificance when
compared with the great moral trophies which distinguish
that epoch. Roads have been constructed;
rivers have been spanned; telegraph and railway
lines have been laid down; time and space have been
annihilated; Nature and the appliances of Nature
have been made to minister to the wants of man.
But these are nothing when compared to the bold,
decisive, statesmanlike measures which have been
taken in hand for the intellectual, the moral and the
political regeneration of my countrymen. Under
English influences the torpor of ages has been dissipated;
the pulsations of a new life have been communicated
to the people; an inspiriting sense of
public duty has been evolved, the spirit of curiosity
has been stirred and a moral revolution, the most
momentous in our annals, culminating in the transformation
of national ideals and aspirations, has been
brought about.”</span>

India is the mother of religions. No other land

founded faiths which have commanded the allegiance
of so large a portion of the human race.
While the Aryans of the West have been content to
borrow their faith from the Hebrews; Indo-Aryans
have produced the most wonderful and mighty
ethnic religion (Brahmanism) and also one of the
three great missionary religions of the world (Buddhism).
A third of the human race today cling with

India's toleration for other religions has been
marked. For twelve centuries she has been the
asylum of Zoroastrianism. Nearly nine-tenths of the
followers of that ancient cult of Persia found and still
enjoy a hospitable home in India. There are more of
the narrow, bigoted followers of Mohammed among
these tolerant people than are found in any other

The Jewish Community in India numbers only
17,000; these are found mostly in Bombay and
Poonah. Perhaps the most interesting colony of
them is that on the west coast in Cochin. I had the
pleasure of visiting them in 1897. There are 1,500 of
them divided into two sections—the White, and the
Black Jews. There is a marked racial difference between
the two. The Blacks were originally the
slaves of the Whites as is shown by their historical
documents. It is not known when the Whites came
to India. Some think that they fled there during the
Jewish exile. More likely they came upon the dispersion
during the first century of our era. The
purity of their blood and the remarkable fairness of
their complexion indicate that the settlement has

people; and in their two synagogues, they conduct
their worship perhaps more like the Jews of twenty
centuries ago than do any other representatives of

larger growth under the peaceable protection of the
Indian, than under the semi-barbarism of the Moslem,
government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This religion was carried into India in 711 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. D.</span></span> at
the point of the sword; and its establishment and
success for centuries was owing to the same method.
This community is not evenly distributed all over
India; for, more than one-third of it is found in
Bengal alone, where it furnishes the majority of the
population. More than one-half of the adherents of
this faith in India are converts from Hinduism.
These were gathered in former centuries when the
Mohammedan power was dominant, and when to be
a member of any other faith than Islam was regarded
as a disability. The Mohammedans of the country
are, on the whole, physically more sturdy and
vigorous than their neighbours. Government, in its
treatment of the people, has to conciliate and regard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with favour this class more than the Hindus who are
four times their number. They possess a great deal
of religious bigotry which is intrenched behind their
dense ignorance. There is a no more ignorant element
than this in the population of India; only six
per cent. of the men are able to read and hardly any of
the women; and they seem, even today, to have a
positive aversion to the schoolhouse. Mohammedanism
had, during the days of its dominance,
considerable influence in the land; but it did very
little to improve the material, moral or religious
condition of the people; and it is a significant fact
that, comparing today the adherents of Islam in
India, with those of Hinduism, the latter are found
not inferior in life, morals and aspirations to the
followers of the prophet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The converts gathered from Mohammedanism by
Christianity are few, though not so few as ordinarily
represented. In North India encouraging success
has been achieved by missions for this class. But in
South India, where their numbers are fewer, efforts in
their behalf have not been so well organised and
have produced smaller results. It is a hard task to
reach and to move this class, owing not only to the
important truth of monotheism, which they hold with
great enthusiasm, but also because of the supreme
ignorance which blinds them equally to the weakness
of their own, and to the excellence of the Christian,
faith.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This faith has had adherents in India for eleven
centuries. Driven out by Mohammedanism from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their home in Persia, the Parsees found refuge in
India. There are only 100,000 of these followers of
Zoroaster in the world. 90,000 of them are in India;
and nearly all of these reside in Bombay and its
vicinity. Their faith, Zoroastrianism, is the purest
of ethnic religions. It has preserved its ancient integrity
and high tone much better than its sister
faith, Brahmanism. Among the members of this
religion are found men possessed of great enterprise,
much wealth, the spirit of progress and of
philanthropy and culture. They give high honour and
position to their women, and in all matters of
civilization are considerably in advance of even the
best class of Hindus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This religion, though from the same source with
Brahmanism, has fundamental differences of doctrine
from that faith. None is more marked or significant
than its Dualism as contrasted with the Pantheism of
its sister faith. The problem of the origin of evil
has found these two diverse interpretations and
these have had a large influence in shaping the
characters, respectively, of these two great ethnic
religions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the far-off common source of these two
religions, indicated by the earliest names and character
of their deities, there is hardly any bond of
fellowship in doctrine, worship or observance between
the fire worshipping Parsee and the Hindu
idolater. And though these Parsees have, for more
than a millennium, made India their home, they have
kept themselves apart from the people of the land
and are still as truly foreigners in the land of their
adoption as are the English residents.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This religion is a child of India; its founder,
Gautama, was the product of that land, and, next to
our Lord Himself, is the greatest among the founders
of religions. Buddhism arose as a reaction, twenty-five
centuries ago, against the excesses of Brahmanism.
It flourished wonderfully for a few centuries,
and at the time when Christ was on earth, had
gained supremacy over the old faith and had become
the State religion in India. Owing to the Brahmanic
revival, in the eighth century of our era, Buddhism
was in its turn, driven out of the land, and has
found refuge in Ceylon and in more eastern countries
from that time until the present. Since then it has
been almost entirely without followers in India
proper. Of the British India possessions Burma is
the only place where it is the popular faith today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still it is not without much influence in the land of
its birth. For, Brahmanism overcame its rival faith
in India only by adopting some of its most fundamental
contentions and teachings. Indeed, modern
Hinduism is largely a blending of the Brahmanism of
old with its supplanter, Buddhism. The abundant
sacrifices which Brahmanism offered were entirely
abolished in deference to Buddhistic sensibilities.
The doctrine of transmigration, through Buddhism,
received new emphasis; and kindness to all living
creatures was extolled to a supreme virtue. As a
climax to this attitude of conciliation Hinduism
finally adopted the Buddha as the ninth incarnation
of Vishnu. Thus, by the irony of history,
Gautama, the Buddha, found a place in the pantheon
of the religion which he gave his life to overthrow;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and today many of the leading aspects of the life
and teaching of the Hindus may be traced, either in
source or in emphasis, to his religion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This religion is an offshoot, or the India remnant,
of Buddhism. It perhaps represents that element
among the followers of the Buddha who declined to
be absorbed into the revived and transformed Brahmanic
faith. Through the many centuries of their
existence as a sect they have spurned every approach
of the Brahmans and have largely stood for Buddhistic
teaching and observances. They have differed
little from Buddhists in their beliefs; for they deny
the authority of the Hindu Vedas, disregard sacrifices,
cultivate a high morality, believe strongly in
transmigration and reverence life in all its forms.
And yet, strangely enough, many of the priests of
their temples are Brahmans and they place Hindu
idols close to their shrines. They differ from the
Buddhists chiefly in their objects of worship and in
their ritual. They have a mythology of their own—a
mythology of saints rather than of gods. These
saints, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Jaina,”</span> (the <span class="tei tei-q">“victorious ones”</span>—those
who have attained perfection through self-victory
and discipline) are worshipped, and furnish an inspiration
to all the devotees of that faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jains, like the Parsees, are found mostly in
Bombay and are a wealthy community, usually engaged
in banking and commerce. They are noted
for their charity, and their philanthropy is largely
directed towards helping the poor among them and
for maintaining hospitals for animals.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This religion, if we may so denominate it, was
founded by Nanak Shah in the fifteenth century.
Nanak Shah was apparently an admirer, if not a follower,
of Kabir, the Hindu reformer who established
a sect which was essentially a compromise between
Hinduism and Mohammedanism. This is the chief
characteristic of Sikhism. It eschewed the polytheism
and idolatry of Hinduism. It taught the unity
of the Godhead, abolished caste, and enforced a high
type of morality. It has, however, subsequently
fallen under the blighting influence of surrounding
Hinduism and has lost much of its distinctive excellence.
So that, according to the census report of
1891, <span class="tei tei-q">“distinction between Sikhs and the rest
of the Brahmanic community is mainly ritualistic....
The only trustworthy method of distinguishing
this creed was to ask if the person in question
repudiated the services of the barber and the
tobacconist; for the precepts most strictly enforced
nowadays (by the Sikhs) are that the hair of the head
and face must never be cut, and that smoking is a
habit to be avoided.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However manifestly the Sikh religion is going the
common way of all the new faiths and religious
revolts of India—the way of reabsorption into Hinduism—it
has done much to create and foster a strong
national feeling. Sikhs were cruelly persecuted by
the then ruling Mohammedans. But the overthrow
of the Moghul Empire gave the Sikhs territorial
power and they possessed the only remaining political
organization in the Punjab. So that, at the advent
of the British, the Sikhs were a mighty power to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dealt with. They became the great power of North
India; and during the Indian mutiny their loyalty to
the British Raj was its salvation. At present the
Sikh nation, warlike and valiant as ever, furnishes,
perhaps, the most stalwart and invincible contingent
for the Indian Army.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the religion of three-fourths of all the inhabitants
of India and of nine-tenths of all those who
are there reached by missionaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What is Hinduism? It is a mixture of Brahmanism,
Buddhism and Devil-worship. As we have seen,
the supplanting faith of Buddha was finally absorbed,
so far as India was concerned, into the old faith.
When, later on, the Brahmans moved towards the
southern part of the peninsula they entered the region
occupied by, and largely given over to, demonolatry.
According to its wont Brahmanism, as modified by
Buddhism, sought not to overthrow the primitive
cult of the people, but to absorb it. Thus, in South
India today, more than three-fourths of the people
are devil worshippers. And yet, with their demons,
they have been accepted into the higher faith of the
Aryan; and, according to their mood and preference,
give themselves to the worship of Hindu gods or
village demons. Worshipping in pure Hindu temples
is to that people but a pastime, a mere holiday diversion;
while the appeasing of the demons at their
village shrines and under old trees in their hamlets is
the most serious concern of their life. And yet all
of them are regarded, and rightly regarded, as
Hindus. Indeed, in the Hinduism of today, especially
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as found in South India, can be found living
amicably together and without any apparent sense of
incongruity or conflict the lowest type of fetishism,
an ardent devil-worship, an engrossing ceremonialism,
a worship of the higher Brahmanical deities, a
thoroughgoing pantheism and a pure theism. I
have witnessed in our district, side by side, a hideous
fetish, a gross idol of a local demon, an image of
Vishnu who is the best of Brahmanical gods, while
in an adjacent hamlet lived families who belonged to
none of these cults but who gave themselves to a
belief in, and practice of, a vague theism which is
farther removed from the fetishism of their neighbours
than is their religion from the highest type of
Christian teaching.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Hinduism may be viewed as an immense
cloth of many colours; which colours have been
patched together without any reference to harmony
or consistency. In other words, that religion is a big
mass of mutually inconsistent and undigested beliefs,
practices and ceremonies. It has not only mutually
antagonistic philosophies, it has also three different
ways of salvation, 330,000,000 gods and as many
laws and customs which, though binding as the
laws of the Medes and Persians, are nevertheless,
absolutely wanting in consistency and in unity of
purpose and teaching. In the words of Sir Alfred
Lyall,—<span class="tei tei-q">“The general character of Indian religion is
that it is unlimited and comprehensive, up to the
point of confusion; it is a boundless sea of divine
beliefs and practices; it encourages the worship of
innumerable gods by an infinite variety of rites; it
permits every doctrine to be taught, every kind of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mystery to be imagined, any sort of theory to be
held as to the inner nature and visible operation of the
divine power.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been the wont of Brahmanism not to directly
antagonize and overthrow the old and the opposing
cults, but rather to absorb them. Note here its
fundamental contrast with Christianity. It meets its
rival with a smile of appreciation, then seeks to
fraternize with it, after which it approves and appropriates
and finally absorbs it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Madura District of South India, where I have
lived, the Brahmans, upon their first arrival, found all
the people given to the worship of their village
demons. They said to them, practically,—<span class="tei tei-q">“We do
not wish to deprive you of your devil shrines and
images and worship. We will take the leading
demons which you worship and marry them to our
great gods and then give to them a place in our
pantheon and a part in our worship. Come ye also
with them and we will welcome you into our temples
and faith.”</span> Thus <span class="tei tei-q">“Meenatchi,”</span> the old and the principal
demoness of the primitive cult of that region,
was married to the great god Siva and became the
presiding goddess of the great Hindu temple of
Madura; and all her old worshippers followed her
into the new faith of Hinduism. So all those people
are Hindus today. And yet they have not abated
one jot of their interest in and practice of their
demonolatry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That which may be regarded as the more strictly
Brahmanical development and manifestation of Hinduism
is divided, at present, into two great cults.
These are Saivism, or the worship of Siva, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Vaishnavism, or the worship of Vishnu. These two
cults, while not mutually antagonistic, are nevertheless
entirely separate—their devotees, respectively,
being satisfied with their own god and his incarnation
and manifestations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first god of the Hindu triad (Brahma, Vishnu
and Siva)—has practically no shrines among Hindus
today. His worship has been largely transferred to
his so-called sons, the Brahmans; and Siva has, in the
main, absorbed all his functions as creator. As it is
only Vishnu, the preserver, and Siva, the destroyer
and recreator that have anything to do with men, the
Hindus devote themselves to these two only. Siva
is the <span class="tei tei-q">“great god,”</span> the austere and terrible one whom
the people fear. He is known chiefly through his
phallic emblem, the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">linga</span></span>,
which emphasizes his
creative activity. Vishnu is the benign god who has
resorted to many incarnations whereby he might free
the world of demons who were worrying and destroying
our race. Siva has many manifestations; Vishnu
alone has <span class="tei tei-q">“descents”</span> or incarnations, some of which
were in brute, and some in human, form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These two cults obtain universally throughout
India. Vaishnavism (the worship of Vishnu) has
many popular sects which wield extensive influence
throughout the country. The one established by
Vallabha-Swami, in the sixteenth century, is a
worship of Krishna and is given to the indulgence
of the passions and is characterised by gross licentiousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sect founded by Chaitanya in the fourteenth
century is one of the most celebrated, and is very
popular in Bengal. It subordinates everything to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
faith (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span>) even making this more important than
caste. Contemplation, rather than ritual, was Chaitanya's
pathway to salvation and he gave supreme
value to the virtue of obedience to the <span class="tei tei-q">“guru”</span> or religious
guide.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In South India the cult of the religious reformer,
Ramanuja, who flourished in the twelfth century,
has extensive popularity. He was a man of great
thought, and his special type of Vedantic philosophy
is much in vogue today. He proclaimed the unity
of God under the name of Vishnu. He received converts
from every caste. It is an interesting fact that
nearly all, in the long list of religious reformers in
India, took a position of hostility to the caste system.
But it is also significant that none of these reform
movements has persisted through the centuries in
that attitude, but has fallen into line with orthodox
Hinduism in absolute submission to the caste demon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sakti</span></span>”</span>
worship has also attained great influence
and extensive predominance in many parts of India.
This is the worship of the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sakti</span></span>
or the female half of the great deities of the land. The
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Saktar</span></span> preëminently
worship <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Kali</span></span>,
the goddess of blood, and the other consorts of Siva.
It is a worship of power
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sakti</span></span>”</span>
means energy or power), and usually power of the
maleficent type. It is perhaps the lowest form of
Hinduism and easily lends itself to a gratification of
the lowest passions of men. This
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">tantric</span></span> cult (the
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">tantras</span></span>
are the sacred books of the Saktar) is the
only one in modern Hinduism which indulges in
bloody sacrifices—<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Kali</span></span>
and her sisters being satisfied
by blood as by nothing else. This attests the non-Aryan
origin and character of this worship, inasmuch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as Brahmanism, since the days of Buddha, abjures all
bloody sacrifice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let it not be supposed, however, from the above
remarks, about the multiform and self-contradictory
character of the amorphous thing called Hinduism,
that it is therefore impossible for us to understand
and measure its nature and power. For Brahmanism,
through all ages, has not been without a definite tendency,
an underlying philosophy and pervasive fundamental
beliefs. It is indeed more a congeries of
faiths than a simple religion, like Christianity. And
yet, amid all its hosts of contradictions and ways of
salvation and sects and cults there have sounded, as
a diapason through all the centuries, the fundamental
teachings of Vedantism. A few doctrines such as
pantheism, transmigration, <span class="tei tei-q">“karma,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“bhakti”</span> and
final absorption into the Supreme Soul are all but
universally held by the people of all sects and
divisions, however much at variance with these
their peculiar beliefs may seem to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prominent staple of Hindu religious thinking
in all ages has doubtless been Vedantism—that subtle
form of pantheism which has charmed and bewildered
not a few of the great minds of the Occident also.
The paramount influence of this philosophy upon all
religious thought and life in India is unmistakable
today, as it has been through the centuries. Of this
Max Müller says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“If the people of India can be said
to have now any system of religion at all ... it
is to be found in the Vedanta philosophy, the leading
tenets of which are known to some extent in every
village.... Nothing will extinguish that ancient
spirit of Vedantism which is breathed by every Hindu
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from his earliest youth, and pervades, in various forms,
even the prayers of the idolater, the speculations of
the philosopher, and the proverbs of the beggar.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may therefore, without hesitation, so far as
Hinduism is concerned regard as philosophic Hinduism
those basal doctrines and their corollaries which,
from the earliest days, have been the stock in trade
of all Indo-Aryan thinkers and at the same time the
source and solvent of all the mysteries of their faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By a study of these one may easily reach the heart
of Hindus and of Hinduism and can weigh and measure
the forces which enter into their religious life and
thinking, and can compare them with the teachings
and institutions of Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This study will bring a twofold blessing to Christians
of the West, especially to missionaries who
have given themselves to the regeneration of India.
It will give them a larger degree of respect for that
great people of the East and a new appreciation for
Hindu thought and religious speculation. We of the
West have been imbued with too much of an intellectual
arrogance and a spirit of contempt for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
benighted Hindu.”</span> Even if we ever learned, we
certainly have too easily forgotten, that many, many
centuries ago—when our ancestors were grovelling
in the lowest depths of primitive savagery—the
rishis of India were engaged in perhaps the highest
self-propelled flights of religious speculation the
world has ever known and were working out a
philosophy, or more correctly a system of ontology,
which is today the wonder and admiration of Western
savants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I argue for a study of those teachings which,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though hoary with age, are today all-important as
the foundation upon which the many-aisled temple
of Hinduism is built and (if I may change the figure)
as the cement which binds the whole structure
together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few years ago it was generally thought that
Brahmanism was little else than the insane ravings
of well-meaning, but unguided, or, worse still, misguided,
denizens of darkness; the whole literature
was considered a mass of intellectual and moral
rubbish. How much the verdict of Western scholars
upon this subject has changed during the last quarter
of a century I need not mention. All men who have
investigated the subject give today unstinted praise
to the heart and intellect of those sages who produced
much of the ancient religious literature of
India. They will not endorse the statement of the
great German philosopher who exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
whole world there is no study so beneficial and so
elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the
solace of my life—it will be the solace of my death.”</span>
And yet many claim that its truths are numerous
and spiritually helpful. Hopkins writes<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
sincerity, the fearless search of the Indic Sages for
truth, their loftiness of thinking, all these will affect
the religious student of every clime and age, though
the fancied result of their thinking may pass without
effect over a modern mind.”</span> And Barth truly
remarks<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
religion of India has not only given
birth to Buddhism and produced, to its own credit,
a code of precepts which is not inferior to any other;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but in the poetry which they have inspired there is at
times a delicacy and bloom of moral sentiment
which the Western world has never seen outside of
Christianity. Nowhere else, perhaps, do we meet
with an equal wealth of fine sentences.”</span> Of their
intellectual acumen Dr. Matheson says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not
too much to say that the mind of the West, with all
its undoubted impulses towards the progress of humanity,
has never exhibited such an intense amount
of intellectual force as is to be found in the religious
speculations of India.... These have been the
cradle of all Western speculations; and wheresoever
the European mind has risen into heights of philosophy,
it has done so because the Brahman has been
the pioneer. There is no intellectual problem in the
West which had not its earliest discussion in the
East; and there is no modern solution of that problem
which will not be found anticipated in the East.”</span>
These words of the Scotch divine are doubtless
strong; too strong, I think. And yet they may be
serviceable, if they warn us against that proneness to
depreciate the intellectual value and serious purpose
of the religious books of that land. It is worse than
useless to confidently descant upon the errors, inconsistencies,
the follies and absurdities of these writings
without acknowledging at the same time the profound
thought, the deep spiritual yearning and the
sublime poetic beauty, which characterize some
portions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this connection the question of the origin of
Hinduism is important.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was formerly laid down as a postulate of the
Christian's belief that Hinduism is of the devil; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that, coming from below, it must be shunned as a
study and denounced root and branch as a thing
purely satanic. This theory has entirely given way
to a more rational belief. The question whether the
truths of Hinduism, with those of other ethnic religions,
have filtered down from some primitive
revelation and are the relics of a vanishing faith,
divinely communicated to some of the earliest members
of our race; or whether God has directly, from
time to time, guided the thoughts and answered the
deep yearnings of the soul of the Indo-Aryan, is one
which is still discussed. But modern scholarship is
practically of one voice in maintaining that God hath
not left Himself without witness among the many
nations of the earth,—a witness that has indeed been
comparatively feeble—a revelation that is dim and
starlike as compared with the noonday brightness
of the Sun of Righteousness in the Christian religion.
The day has come when the Christian must
accept and believe that God has been dealing directly
with this people through the many centuries of their
history, leading them to important truths, even
though their evil hearts and worse lives have caused
them, in many cases, to <span class="tei tei-q">“change the truth of God
into a lie and worship and serve the creature more
than the Creator.”</span> Many of the truths which are
imbedded in the religion of that land find their solution
in no other hypothesis than this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This study of Hinduism will also lead us to realize
the important truth of the many points of contact between
that faith and our own. A knowledge of
their sympathies cannot be of less importance than
that of their antipathies. And this knowledge is indispensable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the Christian worker in India as it
gives a new and a most direct way of approach to
the Hindu heart, and a fresh and all-potent argument
with them in behalf of Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This process also best illustrates the method and
Spirit of Christ. Dr. Robson aptly remarks that
<span class="tei tei-q">“while no religion has done more to overthrow
other religions than Christianity, no religious teacher
has said less against other religions than Christ. We
have from Him only one short saying condemning
the Gentiles' aim in life, but not even one reflecting
on the gods they believed in, or the worship they
paid them. Was not this because He came not to
destroy but to fulfill?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I can refer to only a few of these common points
and belief in the two faiths.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are the only two faiths which have exalted,
to primal importance, this doctrine. In Christianity
it is basal, and in later Brahmanism, or Hinduism, it
has overshadowed nearly every other teaching. In a
sense the all-pervasive pantheism of Brahmanism
made a certain form of incarnation a necessity from
the earliest days. The ancient Aryans could not rest
satisfied with the Unknown and the Absolute of their
Vedantism; so they speedily began to erect for their
evergrowing pantheon an endless procession of
emanations. But it was, probably, the phenomenal
success of Gautama, and especially the posthumous
influence of his life and example, that opened the
eyes of the Brahmans and suggested to them the
supreme need of an <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avatar</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-q">“descent”</span>), for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
popularizing of their faith. And thus originated that
vast system of descents, or incarnations, which have
multiplied so greatly and developed so grotesquely
all over the land. The common ground furnished by
this doctrine to the two faiths is not adequately appreciated.
This truth of incarnation, in its fundamental
doctrinal bearing upon Hinduism, and in the
strengthening of its hold, even until the present,
upon the popular imagination and affection, should
not go for nought in the mind of Christian critics,
because of the content of the multitudinous descents,
which is mostly grotesque, debasing and repulsive.
They forget that the Christian doctrine of incarnation
furnishes, perhaps, the best leverage with which the
Christian missionary is to overturn the faith of that
people, simply because the doctrine itself has been
so popularized, even if debased, in India for many
centuries. Christ should be none the less, yea the
more, welcome to that land because the most popular
god of the Hindu pantheon (Krishna) is also the
leading incarnation of Vishnu.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Christianity this is second in importance only to
the doctrine of incarnation. In Brahmanism also it
has maintained, from the first, a position of cardinal
importance. In pre-Buddhistic days this found expression
in sacrifices that were probably more numerous
and more precious than those offered by any
other people. This is partly shown by the fact that
words used for sacrifice are more numerous in the
Sanskrit than even in the Hebrew language. It is
true that their idea of sacrifice, both as to its import
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and object, was different from ours or from that of
the Israelites; and indeed their own ideas also varied
at different times. Under the influence of Buddhism,
sacrifice, as such, was practically abandoned; but
the idea of atonement for sin, which was underlying
them, they practically carried over into the doctrine
of transmigration. For, however stiffly they contend
that, through metempsychosis, the doctrine of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">karma</span></span>
is realized and every soul atones for its own sin, it
nevertheless remains true that the element of consciousness
separates the person who sinned from him
who suffers; and one becomes the involuntary atoner
and the other the atoned for.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may, to some, seem absurd to bring the two faiths
into anything but the relationship of contrast in this
particular, when it is remembered that we are confronted
daily by a Hinduism which is as grossly
formal, materialistic and sensual as any religion
known in any land. But it is unnecessary to remind
us of the fact that the literature of the faith of this
people is, in some respects, far removed from the low
life and ritual of the present day; and in no greater
respect than in this which we are now considering.
All students recognize in many writings, vedic and
post-vedic, profound seriousness and a sometimes
strange depth of spiritual apprehension coupled with
an other-worldliness which, to the western mind,
seems absurdly impractical. Indeed, the naturally
mystical bent of the Hindu mind has been regarded,
and, doubtless, rightly regarded, as one of the chief
obstacles to a true and easy understanding of much
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that is in their sacred writings by the too practical
Westerner. We should not be blind to the lofty
height of spiritual thought which we occasionally,
and the deep spiritual yearning which we frequently,
are permitted to witness in their books. In evidence
of this we need only to refer to the powerful hold
which the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">yoga</span></span>
system of philosophy and life has
upon them. An intense meditativeness, a devotional
ecstasy and an insight of true heavenly wisdom is
the ideal of life to which the Hindu has been called
from time very remote.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hinduism, as in Christianity, man is directed to
look to a judgment-seat and a system of rewards and
punishments in the world to come. While this
doctrine again, in its development and detail, differs
essentially from that of the Christian faith, it is well
to call attention to it as a point of contact. It
breathes the spirit of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">karma</span></span>,
which, in its retributive
power, has been compared by some to the doctrine
of heredity, and by others, to that of fate.
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span>
demands the full future fruition of every act done in
the body; and many re-births, with intervals of
keener suffering and bliss in numerous hells and
heavens, are the countless steps in the doleful fugue
of emancipation—a process which is enough to appall
any but the patient, stolid soul of a Hindu. And
yet this weary detail of a very long and sisyphean
effort to shake off this mortal coil and to enter into
rest is worthy of the missionary's attention, as it
represents, perhaps, the most elaborate system of
eschatology outside of the New Testament. It is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also ethical in its character, and in its fundamental
principles has chords which harmonize with those of
the Christian doctrine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This doctrine maintains that, by devotion to a personal
god, salvation is achieved. This idea separates
this doctrine from, and apparently antagonizes, the
prevailing philosophy of the land—Vedantism. This
cult of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhakti</span></span>
is connected with Krishnaolatry, which
is the worship of the most unworthy and licentious
god of the Hindu pantheon.

Of Vaishnavism, or the worship of Vishnu, in
which the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span>,

Monier Williams remarks:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Notwithstanding the
gross polytheistic superstitions and hideous idolatry

faiths.”</span> The basal truth of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span>—that of supreme
attachment to, or faith in, a personal god—could
not fail of rousing within the devout lofty and
stirring emotion. <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhaktar</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those who have

even caste and all its demands, and proclaiming the
true oneness of the brotherhood of the faith among

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we have today a large and vigorous class of
Hindus who have subordinated every doctrine and
practice of their religion to that of faith, or
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I believe, with not a few illustrious scholars, that this
doctrine traces its origin to Christianity. Like everything
else which Hinduism had absorbed, it has been
considerably transmuted in the process. It has been
necessarily and greatly affected and degraded by the
character of the gods who have been its objects. It
has been debased by contact with idolatry and error,
with superstition and sensuality. And yet we trace
its lineaments to its lofty, divine origin, and hesitate
not to say that it furnishes a common ground of a
fundamental truth of which Christian missionaries
have not yet sufficiently availed themselves in their
work for this people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hindus have also done not a little thinking in the
elaboration of the doctrine of salvation. In their discussion
as to the relative potency of divine grace and
human agency in the salvation of man they became
divided into two antagonistic schools, corresponding,
very closely, to the Calvinistic and Arminian, among
Christians—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tengaliar</span></span> maintaining the <span class="tei tei-q">“cat
theory”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vadagaliar</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“monkey theory”</span>;
so called because one party holds that, just as the cat
saves her kitten by seizing and carrying it away
bodily, so God seizes and saves man without his own
effort. This is the doctrine of absolute grace. The
other party insists that the relation of the young
monkey to its mother, whereby its rescue from
trouble depends upon its own grasp, best represents
the process of salvation in which man's coöperation
is necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They have also developed the doctrine of growth
in grace sometimes in a very instructive way. The
spiritual development from
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">saloka</span></span> (in the same world
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with God) to <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sāmīpa</span></span>
(in the divine presence) thence to
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sārūpa</span></span>
(in the divine image) and finally to
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sāyujya</span></span>
(complete identity with the divine Being)
bears, in some respects, a striking resemblance to the
teaching of St. Paul, where he writes that Jesus was
<span class="tei tei-q">“made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification
and redemption”</span> (1 Cor. 1:30).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner they teach that, for the attainment
of beatitude, it is necessary to pass through five
stages—(1) that of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sānti</span></span>, quiet repose or calm and
contemplative piety; (2) that of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">dāsya</span></span>, the slave
state—the surrender of the whole will to God; (3)
that of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">sakhya</span></span>,
or friendship; (4) that of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">vātsalya</span></span>, or filial
affection; and (5) that of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">mādhurya</span></span>, or supreme,
all-absorbing love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must refer briefly to only one other illustration
of the probable influence of our religion upon the
faith of India, and that is in its teaching on eschatology.
The illustration is drawn from the tenth
incarnation, <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Kalki avatār</span></span>,
of Vishnu. This incarnation
is to take place hereafter, when Vishnu will
come, at the close of the present
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Kali yuga</span></span>, or iron
age, and put an end to these growing evil times, destroying
with them all the wicked and ushering in the new era of righteousness
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Satya yuga</span></span>) upon the
earth. For this great work of the restoration and the
renovation of all creation, he is to come seated upon
a white horse with a drawn sword, blazing like a
comet. Hindus at present look forward to this new
incarnation as their future deliverer, when the sorrows
and the depravity of this present, shall be swallowed
up in the glories and joys of the future, age.
The striking thing about this teaching is not the hope
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which it inculcates for the future; for that is practically
a part of the Hindu conception of the succession
of the ages of their time system. According to this
the present era must yield to the coming good
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">yuga</span></span>,
which must, in its turn, give way to the ages of
lesser good and of evil, which again will go and
come in their ever-changing cycle. What seems remarkable
is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> in which this idea is here
clothed. The coming of the Deliverer upon a
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Kalki</span></span>—a
white horse—with his great message of universal
destruction and deliverance, brings directly to
our memory the Bible prophecy of Rev. 6:2; 19:11-16,
and also brings us into touch with the belief
of many Christians today as to the appearance and
the work of the Son of Man at the great day of His
Second Coming.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question arises as to how this
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avatar</span></span> originated.
It evidently seems to be an afterthought and
of no ancient date among the series of Vishnu's
descents. And following the ninth, or Buddha,
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avatar</span></span>,
which was clearly intended as a bait to Buddhists,
and as a frank and full compromise with that
hitherto supplanting and hostile faith, it seems natural
to suppose that this tenth also came in the same way
and with the same spirit as a palm leaf to another religion,
even our own, whose prophetic words about
the second coming of Christ could be so easily appropriated
and so harmlessly adopted into the Hindu system.
It thus introduced into their faith an element of
future glory and triumph which the religion had not
formerly possessed. Indeed this very element of aggression
and conquest is one of the signs of its
Western origin and Christian source.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their starting
points are almost antipodal. This will seem evident
when we study their views:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) In reference to religion itself. Christianity is
briefly and beautifully explained by its Founder
(Luke 15) as a divine method of seeking and saving
the lost. It is the expression of the Father's love
yearning for the return, and seeking the complete
salvation, of the son. It is primarily and pervasively
a <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith the Lord”</span>—a revelation from God
manward. Hinduism on the other hand has been
the embodiment of man's aspirations after God.
Wonderfully pathetic, beautiful and elevating these
aspirations have been at times; and doubtless guided
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at points by Him whom they so ardently sought.
They perhaps represent the highest reach of the soul
in its self-propelled flight towards its Maker. It is
true that orthodox Hindus variously describe the
Vedas as eternal, as a direct emanation from Brahma
and as a divine entity in themselves. They constitute
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sruti”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“the directly heard”</span> message of
God to man. But the authors of the Upanishads,
which are a part of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sruti</span></span>,
absolve man from the
necessity of accepting the four Vedas and propound
a way of salvation entirely separate from, and independent
of, vedic prayers and ritual. The direct influence
of the Vedas upon religious life and ritual
in India today is practically <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nil</span></span>; while that of the
Upanishads, which are the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fons et origo</span></span> of the all-potent
philosophy, is felt in every Hindu life, however
humble.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This aspect of the two faiths is not unexpected
when we remember:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Their very dissimilar conceptions of God.
The monotheism of the one and the pantheism of the
other are clear and uncompromising. They have
stood for many centuries as representatives, to the
world, of these very dissimilar beliefs. Christianity
inherited from Judaism its passion for monotheism,
and brings the <span class="tei tei-q">“God of Israel”</span> very near to our race
as the infinitely loving Father. It has not only emphasized
His personality but reveals, with incomparable
power and tenderness, His supreme interest in
our race and His loving purpose concerning it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand Hinduism derived its highest
wisdom and deepest convictions concerning the
Divine Being from the ancient rishis through the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Upanishads. There they accepted, once for all, the
doctrine of the Brahm (neuter)—the one passionless,
immovable, unsearchable, ineffable Being who, without
a second, stands as the source and embodiment
of all real being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Barth truly remarks that <span class="tei tei-q">“this is the most imposing
and subtle of the systems of ontology yet
known in the history of philosophy.”</span> This inscrutable
Being is the only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> existence, all else being illusion
projected by ignorance. This doctrine of
identity or nonduality
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">advaitha</span></span>) lies at the foundation
of all their religious thinking. This Being which
is devoid of qualities (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">nirguna</span></span>),
because incomprehensible to man, can be of no comfort to him. In
this respect the Hindu is an agnostic of a profound
type.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For this mystical philosophy one word of praise is
eminently due. It is not to be confounded with that
species of Western pantheism which is rank materialism—making
God and the material universe convertible
terms. Sir William Jones emphasized this
difference—the difference between a system which,
in all that it sees, sees God alone, and that which
acknowledges no God beyond what it sees. One is
the bulwark of materialism; the other its most uncompromising
enemy. Whatever the defects of this
philosophy of the Upanishads it must be confessed
to be deeply spiritual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet in this very effort to conserve the spiritual
and transcendental character of Brâhm the Aryan
sage has covered Him with the dark robe of mysticism
and pushed Him into a far off realm beyond
human ken.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So that the only intimations which man has of
Him are confessedly false projection of ignorance.
For all practical purposes this hypothetical deity—for
the very existence of Brâhm is only assumed as a
working hypothesis by the theosophist—is a nonentity
to the worshipper. How can a being lend itself to
a devout soul in worship when it is rigidly devoid of
every quality that can inspire or attract the soul?
This very fact has led the ordinary Hindu to seek
and develop something else as an object of his devotion.
Hence the polytheism of Brahmanism. Let it
not be supposed that there is any antagonism between
their pantheism and their polytheism. One is
the natural offspring of the other. The numberless
gods which today are supposed to preside over the
destiny of the people, are but emanations, the so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">“play”</span> of Brâhm. Properly speaking they
are neither supreme nor possessed of truly divine attributes.
Even the Hindu Triad—Brahma (masculine
gender), Vishnu and Siva—are but manifestations of
the delight of the eternal Soul to invest itself with
qualities (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">guna</span></span>).
These three gods are no more real
existences than are the myriad other children of illusion
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">maya</span></span>)
and ignorance (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidya</span></span>)
which constitute the universe. And as they had their existence, so
will they find their dissolution, in the fiat of the
Supreme Soul. India finds polytheism no more satisfying
than it does pantheism. There is no more
assurance of comfort in worshipping 330,000,000
gods, whose multitude not only bewilders but also
carries in itself refutation to the claim of any one to
be supreme, than there is in the yearning after an
absolute, ineffable Being which cruelly evades human
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thought and definition. It is no wonder therefore
that the growth of the Hindu pantheon is constant,
and both follows, and bears testimony to, the craving
of the human soul for a God who can satisfy its
wants and realize its deepest longings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Their theories of the universe are also divergent.
According to the Bible the outer world is the
creation, by God, out of nothing. To the Brahman
of all times the idea of pure creation has seemed absurd.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex nihilo nihil fit</span></span>
is an axiom of all their
philosophies. Whether it be the Vedantin who tells
us that the material universe is the result of Brâhm
invested with illusion, or the Sankya philosopher
who attributes it to
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">prakriti</span></span>—the
power of nature; or the Veisashika sage who traces it to eternal atoms;
they all practically posit that it is eternal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of course the Christian doctrine of creation from
nothing does not, as the Hindu too often assumes,
maintain that the universe is a result without a cause;
for it teaches that God Himself, by the exercise of
His sovereign will and omnipotence, is an all-adequate
cause to all created things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the Vedantin claims that creation is impossible,
how can he at the same time believe that ideas have
from time to time sprung up in the mind of Brâhm,
which ideas themselves have put on illusion and appear
to human ignorance as the universe? It is, to
say the least, no easier for him, with his conception
of Brâhm, to account for the origin of such ideas
than it is for the Christian to trace the source of the
material universe to an all-wise and omnipotent God.
Nor does the Sankya philosopher, by practically denying
God and positing the eternal existence of souls
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">prakriti</span></span>,
remove half the difficulties that he
creates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Again, the teachings of the two faiths concerning
man are no less divergent. In the Bible man
is represented as a son of God. He is fallen indeed,
but with a trace, even in his degradation, of his
Father's lineaments. We follow him in his willful
rebellion against his Father; he plunges into the lowest
depths of sin. But we still recognise in him the
promise of infinite and eternal possibilities of spiritual
expansion and happiness. Indeed we find at work a
divinely benevolent scheme through which he is to
be ultimately exalted to heavenly places in Christ
Jesus and made the heir of infinite bliss.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, Hindu Shastras represent man
as mere illusion—the poor plaything of the absolute
One. For man to assume and to declare his own
real existence is, they say, but the raving of his ignorance
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidya</span></span>).
To the practical Western mind it
seems almost impossible that a philosopher should be
so lost in his philosophy as to aver that he, the
thinker and father of his philosophy, has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> existence—is
only illusion, concerning which real existence
can only be assumed for practical purposes.
What must be said of the philosophy begotten by
such an illusive being? Shall it not also be doomed
to vanish with him into the nothingness whence he
came and which he now really is, if he only knew
it? Sir Monier Williams aptly remarks,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Common
sense tells an Englishman that he really exists
himself and that everything he sees around him
really exists also. He cannot abandon these two
primary convictions. Not so the Hindu Vedantist.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dualism is his bugbear, and common sense, when it
maintains any kind of real duality, either the separate
independent existence of a man's own spirit and of
God's spirit, or of spirit and matter, is guilty of gross
deception.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another conception regards the human soul
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">jivatma</span></span>)
as a part of the Supreme Soul. This
theory adds small comfort or dignity to it when we
remember that this whole of which it is declared a
part is an intangible, unattractive Being—devoid of
all qualities (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">nirguna</span></span>).
If the soul existed from
eternity as a part of the divine Soul and will ultimately
resume that interrupted existence, what value,
ethical or otherwise, can be attached to that bondage
of manhood which was thrust upon the soul (or was
it voluntarily assumed?)? This part of deity called
individual soul certainly cannot be improved by its
human conditions; and the question is not—<span class="tei tei-q">“How
soon can I pass through this slough of despond,”</span>
but, <span class="tei tei-q">“why was I thrust into it at all? Was it a
mere sacred whim
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">tiruvileiadal</span></span>) of Brâhm?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover this view of human <span class="tei tei-q">“self,”</span> or soul, carries
one out too far into the sea of transcendental
metaphysics to be of any practical use, religiously.
We know something of man—this strange compound
of soul and body—and we are deeply interested in
his history and destiny; the more deeply because we
are included in this category.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But who knows of the eternal soul—that part of
the absolute—separate from human conditions and
apart from all experiences of men? Is it not simply
the dream of the philosopher, a convenient assumption
to satisfy the needs of an impractical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ontology? To magnify the soul apart from human
life, and to interpret human life as the self's lowest
degradation and something which is to be shaken off
as quickly as possible, can hardly be sound philosophy,
and is certainly bad theology. It simply reduces
this life into an irremedial evil, with no moral
significance or spiritual value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This leads us to the second point of contrast:—
</p>

</div>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">
<a name="toc34" id="toc34"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What do these two religions promise to do for
those who embrace them? The work which Christianity
proposes to itself is difficult and glorious. It
takes fallen, sin-sodden, man and leads him out into
a new life of holiness; it opens out to him a long and
broad vista of life with an ever-enlarging, blissful,
activity. Christ said that He came into the world
that men might have life and have it abundantly.
He came not only to save the lost but also to develop
all the grand possibilities of the soul to their utmost,
and to launch the human bark upon a voyage of everlasting
life, which means unceasing growth in all its
noblest qualities, activities and enjoyments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hindu philosophy and faith, on the other hand,
unite in commanding that human endowments be
starved, qualities suppressed, activity of all kinds
stayed, ambition and every other desire, even the
noblest and purest, quenched. All the essential elements
of life itself are to be mortified that the soul
may, unhampered by its own entanglement, reach
that consummation which is supposed to be final.
And what is it? Who can tell? The Aryan philosopher
himself stands mute in its presence. All
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that we can predicate of it is not life and happiness,
according to any standard of human experience
known or imagined. The idea that the individual
soul will finally sink into and blend with the
Absolute Being as a drop of water returns to and
mingles with its mother ocean may seem plausible
to the philosopher; but of such an hypothetical
existence we know absolutely nothing and can
expect nothing that would inspire hope and kindle
ambition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hinduism there are heavens many and not a few
hells. But unlike the places of reward and punishment
connected with Christianity, they represent
nothing final. They are more like the purgatory of
the Catholics, and represent only steps in the progress
of the soul towards emancipation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Concerning the general view of human life, its import
and outcome, the two faiths are antipodal.
Christianity is brightly optimistic. The future of
every Christian is to be as the sun shining more and
more until the perfect day. Unceasing progress and
eternal expansion are held out before him. His is an
heritage that will abide and will resound in an ever
increasing anthem of praise throughout time and
eternity. Nothing can occur hereafter to rob him of
that crown of glory which is the gift of God and
which is to result in likeness to Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hinduism, on the other hand, is essentially pessimistic.
It teaches that human life is totally and
irremediably evil. Every power of the soul must be
exercised in the endeavour to shake off this terrible
burden of separate human existence and escape all
the conditions of this life. That is the only relief
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possible. To the Hindu the question so often discussed
in Christian lands—<span class="tei tei-q">“Is life worth living?”</span>—has
no interest, since it has but one answer possible.
And even if the Indian sage forgets his present conditions
and pessimism long enough to gaze down
the long and dismal vista of numberless births to the
final consummation
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sayujya</span></span>)—the
final union with God—he finds in that nothing which the Christian
does not discover in tenfold richness and beauty in
the Bible. To be partaker of the Divine Nature is a
blessed reality to the Christian without his forfeiting,
in the least, the dignity of self-identity and the glory
of separate personal consciousness. To have the
<span class="tei tei-q">“life hid with Christ in God”</span>; to be able triumphantly
to exclaim—<span class="tei tei-q">“I live; yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me”</span>; to experience the blessedness and
power of abiding in Christ and to realize the answer
to Christ's own prayer to the Father—<span class="tei tei-q">“that they also
may be in us”</span>—all this is the joy and hope of the Christian
in a manner and to a degree utterly impossible
to the Hindu whose union with the supreme spirit is
the loss and end of self, including all those faculties
which are capable of enjoyment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking from another standpoint, we perceive that
the aim of the religion of Christ is the banishing of
sin from the life and the establishing of character.
Sin is the dark background of Christianity. It explains
its origin and reveals its universality. Its
whole concern is with the emancipation of man from
the presence and power of sin. To the Vedantin,
on the other hand, sin, in the Christian sense of it, is
an impossibility. Where God is all and all is God
there can be no separate will to antagonize the divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will. Monism necessarily, in the last analysis,
carries every act and motive back to the supreme
Will and establishes an all-inclusive necessitarianism
which is fatal to human freedom; and it therefore
excludes sin as an act of rebellion against God.
Much is made of sin, so called, in the Hindu system,
as we shall presently see; but nowhere is more care
needed than here that we may distinguish between
ideas conveyed by this word in these two faiths. In
Christianity the ethical character of sin is emphasized.
It is described as a thing of moral obliquity and
spiritual darkness. According to the Upanishads the
only defect of man is an intellectual one. He is in
bondage to ignorance. Plato made ignorance the
chief source of moral evil and proposed philosophy
as a remedy for the malady. The Vedantin differs
from the Greek philosopher only in his more absolute
condemnation of (<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidya</span></span>)
ignorance as the mother of
all human ills. Remove this—let a man attain unto a
true knowledge of self, of the fact that he has no
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> separate existence and is one with the Supreme
Soul—and he becomes thereby qualified for his
emancipation and ends his long cycle of births.
Moreover, in the polytheism of the Puranas and in
the laws and customs of Manu sin generally means
only ceremonial defilement and the violation of
customs and usages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hinduism, therefore, has never addressed itself to
the task of helping man as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sinner</span></em>—of regenerating
his heart, of establishing within him that
beautiful thing known in Christian lands and philosophies
as a well rounded, symmetrical and perfect
character. For many reasons and in many ways
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it has aimed at a very different consummation in
man from that consistently sought by Christ and
His religion.

to by those Faiths Respectively.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By what power and instrumentality are the above
ends to be sought and attained? They will be,
doubtless, quite as divergent as the aims themselves
were found to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Christianity God Himself is the agent who
works out its scheme of salvation. He entered,
through infinite condescension, into human life and
relations in the Incarnation. He wrought, in the
days of His flesh, the redemption of our race—a
work which finds its climax in His atoning death.
In the person of the Holy Spirit He is working and
bringing to full fruition, in the hearts and lives of
men, the redemption which He wrought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Into this, man enters not as an efficient cause of
his own redemption. He cannot atone for his past,
nor has he the assurance within himself for the
future. Hence the atoning sacrifice of Christ and the
indwelling of the Spirit of God which becomes in
him a source of peace, of power and of hope. Yet,
in this divine work, man is neither passive nor
apathetic. In the exercise of saving faith he not only
appropriates the works and gifts of God but also
enters into full and active harmony and coöperation
with God in his own regeneration and salvation.
So that the Apostle Paul aptly urges the Philippian
Christians (Phil. 2:12) to <span class="tei tei-q">“work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which worketh in you both to will and to work for
His good pleasure.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How different is the picture presented to us by the
Hindu Shastras of the means of human redemption—a
picture, however, consonant with the aims which
they have set before themselves to accomplish for
man. The first and all-present fact of this faith is
the terrible loneliness and isolation of man in the
great struggle of life. His destiny is in his own
hands, and he must fight single-handed against a
thousand odds in the awful battle for emancipation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span>
is the word used to express this thought
which has possessed the Hindu mind from the
earliest days to the present. This word may be
translated <span class="tei tei-q">“works,”</span> and means the acts by which
the soul determines its own destiny. In Vedic times
the all-powerful works were sacrifice and ritual. In
the Upanishads they are meditation and self-mortification.
Today they are ceremonial, with works of
charity, self-renunciation or religious mendicancy
generally added.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In pre-Buddhistic days sacrifice abounded in Brahmanism;
and it grew to such proportions that the
revolt headed by Gautama and incarnated in Buddhism
became universal. But vicariousness was largely
wanting as an element in, and as a cause of, their
sacrifices. They were rather offered with a view to
nourish the gods and as a means of acquiring power.
He who sacrificed a hundred horses was said to gain
thereby even larger power than Indra himself possessed—a
power which enabled him to dethrone this
god of the heavens. Such was the power said to
inhere in sacrifice that the gods themselves combined
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to prevent men from the practice lest they should rise
to larger power than themselves! With the triumph
and subsequent absorption of Buddhism into Brahmanism
the latter abandoned its sacrifices and accepted
the Buddhistic emphasis upon
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span>, and
doomed every soul to the tread-mill of its own
destiny. To every human word, deed or thought,
however insignificant, there is fruit which must be
eaten by the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is claimed for this doctrine that it well emphasizes
the conservation of moral force. Christianity also
conserves, to the last, moral force; not however by
insisting upon man bearing himself the whole burden,
but by enabling him to cast the burden upon the
Lord who graciously offers to bear the load of human
guilt belonging to every soul.

Another word in India which is synonymous with
large power and merit is
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span>. It is inculcated in
the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span>
philosophy and is supposed to stand for a
high mental discipline which speedily qualifies one
for absorption into the Deity. It is manifested in the
form of abstract meditation and austerity—an austerity
embodied in asceticism and self-mortification.
From early times this method has been held high in
honour, and today is universally esteemed as the most
powerful and speedy boat wherewith to cross the
sullen stream of human existence. The grand object
of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span>
is to teach how to concentrate the mind—an
object based upon the idea that the great and sole
need of man is not moral and spiritual regeneration,
but more light, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a clear, intellectual apprehension
of things. Not only is this basis of philosophy false
in supposing that such intellectual gymnastics can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
finally exalt and save a soul, it is also radically defective
in its general rules and practical results. No one
who has studied the childish rules which are prescribed
to the Yogis, or has observed in India many
of even the better type of Yogis can fail to be impressed
with the degradation to mind and morals
which is indissolubly connected with it. Barth's
observation on the processes of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span> is eminently
true. <span class="tei tei-q">“Conscientiously observed,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
can only issue in folly and idiocy; and it is, in fact,
under the image of a fool or an idiot that the wise
man is often delineated for us in the
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Puranas</span></span> for
instance.”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>

Meditation upon the Divine Being and upon self is
a supreme duty inculcated by Christianity. Here
God is a Personality upon whom the mind can be
centred and find rest and exaltation. The self also
is conceived as a being with a separate and infinitely
high destiny marked out before it. Concentrated
thought, deep emotion and lofty purpose, in view of
these objects, is supremely profitable. But what is
there left worthy of thought for the Vedantist
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yogi</span></span>
when the Divine Being is the unknowable and the
Yogi himself the deluded child of
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Maya</span></span>) illusion and
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avidya</span></span>)
ignorance—those twin enemies to all true
and worthy knowledge? It cannot be elevating to
detach the mind from things worldly and attach it to
nothing!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Incarnation, as we have seen above, has in later
times become a popular doctrine in India. The
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avatars</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-q">“descents”</span>) of members of the Hindu
pantheon, especially of Vishnu, the second member
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Triad, wield a large influence in the religious
life of the masses. Yet the doctrines should, by no
means, be regarded as identical or even similar in
Hinduism and Christianity. It should be remembered
that in Hinduism it is believed and magnified
by those who also hold the law of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span> as supreme.
There is hardly a Vaishnavite and Krishnaolater who
does not believe firmly that his destiny is writ large
upon his forehead—that nothing that this or any god
may do can affect his <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">adrishta</span></span>
which is that felt but unseen power working out the
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma vivaka</span></span>, or
fruition of works, done by him in former births.
This belief directly antagonizes incarnation from the
Christian standpoint, where it appears as God's
mighty instrument of grace to man. Not so from
the Hindu standpoint. The incarnations of Vishnu
are referred to in their
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Shastras</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“as consequences of
deeds which the god himself had performed. One
was the fruit of sins he had committed; another of a
curse which had been pronounced upon him.”</span> And
yet they are doubtless frequently referred to as undertaken
with a view to benefit and help our race. If
such was their intention it is difficult to see how that
benefit could be any other than racial and temporary;
for there is no intimation in any of them of its being
a means for the spiritual uplifting, or moral regeneration,
of one human soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no finality of blessing supposed to be in
any Hindu incarnation; and it would be sacrilege to
compare the character of any one of them with the
wonderful incarnation of Jesus. It is not so much
that many of them appear as fish, fowl and beast,
and as such are devoid of moral aim and efficiency;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not a few are immoral, some of them, like Krishna,
representing the worst type of sensuality and moral
obliquity. Such examples, in the popular mythology
of the land, have done, and are doing, inexpressible
harm to the people and the country. <span class="tei tei-q">“Like God like
people”</span>; and when the god is highly popular and
conspicuously immoral the result will be correspondingly
great.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In connection with the doctrine of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">avatar</span></span> has
arisen the well-known
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti marga</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“the way of
faith.”</span> Many believe that the latter was the source
of the former and that both were affected by Christian
teaching. In any case they are closely connected.
Among many this way of love and devotion
to individual gods has gained preëminence over the
other two ways of salvation—knowledge
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">gnana marga</span></span>) and works
(<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma-marga</span></span>)—though
it should not be forgotten that
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span> itself is regarded as a
work of merit and is by no means synonymous with
Christian faith. Yet it must be confessed, as we
have seen above, that Hinduism comes nearer, at this
point than at any other, to touching the religion of
Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blindness of this faith is also a serious objection
to it. To the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhaktan</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“faith is the great thing.”</span>
It matters not how hideous, morally and spiritually,
the object of faith may be,
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhakti</span></span> will triumphantly
vindicate itself in the ultimate salvation of the soul.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Repose faith in the idols, in ceremonial observances,
in ascetic performances, in all that you religiously
do, and blessing will rest upon you.”</span> This is
the <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">bhaktan's</span></span>
creed; it is essentially the teaching of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Song”</span>—Bhagavad-Gita. And it is this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which has so powerfully helped the moral and spiritual
degeneracy of India during the past few centuries.
Men have attached themselves absolutely to
gods whose mythology, detailed in the
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Puranas</span></span> and
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Tantras</span></span>,
is a narrative of lust and of moral crookedness,
devotion to which can mean only moral contamination
and spiritual death. Such a faith, in its
nature and results, can only be contrasted with a
loving devotion to the incomparably holy and lovely
Jesus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In other words we inquire, in what manner do
they propose to attain unto their respective ends?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity brings man into the new, divine life
through the narrow gate of a new birth. He stands
justified before God and, under the influence of the
Holy Spirit, he begins that course of spiritual development
which steadily progresses towards perfection
in truth and holiness. He, <span class="tei tei-q">“beholding as in a glass
the glory of the Lord is changed into the same image
from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the
Lord.”</span> And in the fullness of his acquired, or
divinely bestowed, powers he passes through the
gate of death, once for all, to enter upon the full
glories of eternal life beyond.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hinduism <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metempsychosis</span></em> is the great process.
<span class="tei tei-q">“As the embodied soul,”</span> says the Bhagavad-Gita,
<span class="tei tei-q">“moves swiftly on through boyhood, youth
and age, so will it pass through other forms hereafter.”</span>
This doctrine is universally regarded as the
all-potent solvent of human ills and the process
which alone can lead to ultimate rest. In transmigration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the soul is supposed to pass on from body
to body in its wearisome, dismal progress, towards
emancipation. The bodies in which it is incarcerated
will be of all grades, according to the character of the
life in the previous births, from the august and divine
body of a Brahman down to a tenement of inorganic,
lifeless rock. From ancient times this weary
process of working out the law of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span> has seized
upon the imagination and wrought itself into the
very being of the people of India; so that today it is
the universal way of salvation believed and taught
by the Vedantin, accepted with assurance by the
idolater, and the one great bugbear in the mind of
even the common coolie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This doctrine has its roots in Vedantism and is an
essential part of it. The Brahman theosophist taught
that all souls emanated from Brâhm and must return
to their source along the way of metempsychosis.
All acts, words and thoughts find their exact reward
in future births. If a man steals a cow he shall be
reborn as a crocodile or lizard; if grain, as a rat; if
fruit, as an ape. The murderer of a Brahman endures
long-suffering in the several hells and is then
born again in the meanest bodies to atone for his
crime. According to Manu the soul might pass
<span class="tei tei-q">“through ten thousand millions”</span> of births. The
passageway to absorption is through Brahmanhood
only. Transmigration is the doom of all others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prevalence of this doctrine in India is one of
the saddest facts connected with its life. It is
sombre and depressing in the extreme and robs the
mind of a good portion of the small comfort which
the idea of absorption might otherwise bring to it.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Though the doctrine has found a footing among
other nations at different periods in their history, nowhere
else has it prevailed so long and exercised
such a mighty influence over high and low as it has
in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine is based upon a hypothetical identity
of soul in different successive bodies—a hypothesis
which can never be proved, and which contradicts
the universal consciousness. Until that erratic Englishwoman,
Mrs. Besant, appeared, no one claimed
to possess the first intimation, through consciousness
or memory, of a previous existence in another body.
Ancient rishis and a few others were said by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">others</span></em>
to have possessed it. Strange, if such a re-incarnation
were a fact, that none has ever been assured of it by
any other agent than the philosopher in his search
after truth. Stranger still that men in such countless
millions should hang their whole destiny upon so
rotten a cord—so unethical a theory—as is here involved.
Why should any moral being be put
through a course of discipline, or be punished, for a
past of which he has no knowledge? To inflict a
punishment for any conduct or thought to which the
memory does not bear evidence, nor conscience furnish
assent, nor the whole realm of conscious experience
reveal a trace, is both unethical and in violation
of the deepest laws of being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor does it appear how this process, as a method
of discipline, can achieve what is expected of it. It
is maintained that, ultimately, all the myriads of
separate souls will cross over this terrible stream of
human existence and reach the further shore of
emancipation. But what aptitude, or efficiency,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there can be in metempsychosis itself to reach this
end is not apparent. That the soul should ultimately
reach beatitude rather than absolute, irremedial, degradation
through this process is merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em>, and
that without adequate foundation in reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In view of the well-known power of sin and its
tendency to settle down, through habit, into a
permanent type of character; in view of the well-attested
scientific doctrine of heredity—a doctrine
which easily accounts for and explains every semblance
of truth in transmigration—it seems incredible
that any soul in India could, through transmigration,
finally emerge out of the quicksand of sin and corruption
which surround and overwhelm it, especially
when it is assumed that it has already passed through
many births.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should also be remembered that, at its basis, this
doctrine has its face turned, with equal repugnance,
against all sorts of work. Desire of every kind, good
as well as evil, is to be suppressed inasmuch as it is
the source of action, and action must bear its fruit,
the eating of which prolongs existence which, itself,
is the burden to be removed. The question is not
how to become good and to overcome evil in life,
but how to shake off all personality. And this is
accomplished, they say, by abandoning all action and
suppressing all desire whatever. How this can result
in holiness and lofty character is not evident. It
is true that a certain sort of <span class="tei tei-q">“good works”</span> have
large value in this process of emancipation. But
quiescence rather than character is the thing emphasized.
Noble thoughts and aspirations are as
fatal as are the basest to immediate deliverance—they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all disturb that equilibrium of the soul which ushers
it into its final rest. <span class="tei tei-q">“The confinement of fetters is
the same whether the chain is of gold or of iron.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is doubtless true that this doctrine has some
elements of truth, otherwise it could not have
survived and thriven as it has. It bears consistent
testimony to the immortality of the soul. It also
teaches the important truth that the soul must receive
the full reward of all its deeds in a body. It is also,
in a certain way, a response to that deep instinct of
justice which is a part of human nature. But these
cannot atone for its fundamental defects and errors.
Some claim that its highest merit is that it is a powerful
deterrent from sin and incentive to virtue. Beyond
the remarks made above the all-sufficient refutation
to such a statement is the present condition of the
Hindu race itself. If any people on earth, more than
others, sin with <span class="tei tei-q">“fatal facility”</span> and seem perfectly
oblivious to the character and consequences of their
deeds they are the descendants of the rishis of old
and the heirs, in rich abundance, of this and its
cognate doctrines. To judge this doctrine by its
results in India is to pronounce it an error and a curse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No religion can regenerate or exalt men simply
through a code of moral laws, or even through impassioned
appeals to a higher life and threats of
eternal punishment. There must be, above and beyond
all this, a life which stands boldly forth as an
example and inspiration to good men. The noble
example of the royal Gautama did more perhaps than
any other thing to disseminate Buddhism throughout
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
India. His supreme renunciation and his loyalty to
truth exalted him before his disciples and transformed
him into an ideal for Buddhists of future ages. This
also is a preëminent characteristic of Christianity.
It is the religion of the Christ. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> stands supreme in
it—not merely as its Founder, Expounder and Life.
He is also the embodiment of His own teaching, the
ideal of life and conduct which He has brought to
men. His command to all is not—<span class="tei tei-q">“Do this or
that”</span>; but <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow Me”</span>—not, <span class="tei tei-q">“Believe in this
truth or another,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“Believe in Me,”</span> who am
<span class="tei tei-q">“the way, the truth and the life.”</span> For these twenty
centuries He has stood before the world as the incomparable,
unapproachable, perfect ideal which has
wrought more for the regeneration of the world
than all other forces put together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do we find any counterpart to this in Hinduism?
Do we find any life or example which stands related
to it as Buddha's to Buddhism or as Mohammed's
to Mohammedanism, or, even in a slight
degree, as Christ's to Christianity? None whatever.
Starting with the absolute Brâhm, we have seen this
Supreme Soul shrouded in unfathomable, unapproachable
darkness. We descend to the divine
emanations of this eternal Soul and search in vain
among the millions of beings which constitute the
Hindu pantheon to find one who could become an
ideal of life and an inspiration to the soul struggling
against sin. <span class="tei tei-q">“Godlike life could scarcely start from
its examples of incarnations; for none of their lives
is superhuman in holiness. Even Rama, the most
blameless character in Hindu mythological literature,
is by no means perfect; while the most popularly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worshipped incarnation committed deeds so vile that
even the narrator warns his hearers not to take him
for their example. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Listen to the story of Hari, but
do not think of doing his deeds,’</span> he says.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We look again at the sages and heroes of India
with the hope that we may possibly find one who
stood conspicuous among others as the perfect type
of character and the helper of those struggling after a
better and holier life. Here again we are wofully
disappointed, though it must be confessed that there
are loftier types of goodness and of self-discipline
among them than we found among the gods. Thus,
with no worthy ideal of life before them and no one
to inspire them to better things, the wonder is
that men in India have not descended to a lower level
than they have. It is perhaps this very reason that
has discouraged them and has led them to strive to
attain unto beatitude, not by perfecting, but by destroying
humanity. The renunciation and loss, rather
than the realization, of self has thus become their aim
and ambition. Perhaps it is for this same reason also
that the votaries of this faith have constructed one of
the most elaborate systems of ceremonial and ritual
that the world has ever witnessed; whereby, in the
absence of a high ideal and of a divine inspiration,
the whole life from birth even until after death, may
be directed and protected from evil.

The theories of their inspiration are dissimilar. In
the Bible there is no theory of inspiration taught.
Its testimony to its own divine origin is indirect
rather than direct. And yet the evidence, both internal
and external, that the Bible was written by
men under Divine guidance and inspiration is unmistakable
and convincing. Whether we have regard
to its prophetic utterances, its record of miracles,
its plan of salvation, its delineation of the incomparable
life and character of Jesus Christ; or whether we
behold its marvellous power among men of all classes
and of all countries and tongues—all that pertain to
it point unmistakably to its divine origin.

Nor can any one fail to appreciate the beauty and

great excellence of the Bhagavad-Gita which is the
gem of all Hindu literature. And yet the puerilities
of many and the obscenity of others of the Vedic
songs and prayers are well-known. So are the
strange vagaries and the rambling character of many
parts of the Upanishads. And as for the Bhagavad-Gita
it is simply a dialogue whose gist is the argument
of Krishna—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Supreme God”</span>—to urge the
tender-hearted and the conscience-smitten Arjuna to
slay his relatives in war. Its argument is that no evil
which one man may do to another is of any moment,
since he cannot touch his soul which is eternal and
beyond the reach of any human power! In the
destiny of a soul what can the destruction of one of
its bodies signify? This is an argument which is
subversive of morality and of social order.

book. We should have looked forward to a
gradual transition from the starry midnight of the
far-off past to the rising, in Christ, of the sun of
righteousness with healing in His wings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hindu literature this process is reversed. The
surest, I may almost say, the only, evidence we have
of divine guidance in the production of this literature
is to be found among the earliest productions. There
we see earnestness of purpose combined with heavenly
aspiration and deep searching after truth. Subsequent
to this we see the light vanishing and earnestness
giving place to triviality of thought, to the
ravings of superstition, to the inanities of ceremonialism
and to the laws of social and religious bondage.
All this progress downward is in direct ratio to our
distance from Vedic times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What could be more conclusive proof of the
human source and direction of these prolific writings?
Educated Hindus are sensible of this fact.
They constantly hark back to the Vedas, to the Upanishads
and to the Bhagavad-Gita, conscious of the
fact that these represent the high water-mark of their
faith and literature.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are not a few, and they aid in presenting the
two faiths in bold relief.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Their attitude towards the individual and Society.
Nowhere are they more antipodal to each
other than here. Christianity is preëminently a faith
which exalts the individual. It presents, with
marked clearness, his rights and responsibilities. His
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
liberty of thought, of belief and of action, is fundamentally
sacred and to be conserved at all hazards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hinduism is the staunchest foe of individual freedom.
It concedes no right to the individual which
others are bound to respect. It has erected above
the individual, and in such a way as to overshadow
him entirely, the stupendous caste system. And it
has subordinated his every right and privilege to the
whim of this demon caste. Man is its abject slave—cannot
swerve one inch from its dictates; and these
reach down to the smallest detail of his life. If the
vast majority of the members of a caste were high in
their morals and strict in their integrity and pure in
their beliefs, the aid to a higher life which this
system might render to the individual would, in
small part, compensate for its destruction of his
manly independence. But caste discipline directs
itself to petty forms and observances and to the perpetuation
of mean jealousies rather than to the development
of character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India alone is caste a religious institution. The
Brahman merged the individual in the corporate
body, thus perfecting his bondage; and he set class
against class to prevent the lower from rising and to
make national union impossible. Men were said to
have been created differently even as different kinds
of animals; to bring them together is as unnatural as
it is sinful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, every man within the pale of this religion
has his social, as his religious, status fixed unchangeably
for him before his birth; and woe be to him
who tries to shake off this bondage, or even in a
small degree to kick against the pricks. No better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
system than this has been devised under heaven to
rob man of his birthright of independence and self-respect.
And the population of India bears, in its
character and conduct, ample testimony to the truth
of this statement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Connected closely with this is another aspect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The religion of Jesus fosters progress. Not only
do we behold Christian nations the most progressive,
we also find that as this faith obtains in its purity, so
do its votaries enjoy the large spirit and results of
progress, both in religion, science, the arts and in
civilization. In India, on the other hand, conservatism
is a fetish and custom a divine law of conduct.
In the West the question asked, as men approach a
certain line of action, is whether it be reasonable?
Among Hindus the invariable inquiry is,—is it customary?—did
our forefathers practice it? This again
is the legitimate product of the caste system. It conserves
and deifies the past. It never tolerates a
question as to the wisdom of the ancients. The code
of Manu, which is the source and supreme authority
for this system, has done more to stereotype and degrade
social and religious life in India than has any
other code in all the history of other lands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Another marked feature of the religion of
Jesus is its exclusiveness. It claims to be the only
way of salvation. Not that it is unwilling to acknowledge
the truths which are found in other
faiths. While it recognizes such, it maintains that
they are but broken lights of the Truth which it presents
in all its full-orbed glory. It reveals Christ as
the fulfillment of the good and pious of all nations,
and His revelation as the realization of all truth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wherever found. But as a means of salvation it
stands alone, and will brook no rivalry nor accept
divided homage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hinduism, on the other hand, we see tolerance
incarnate. It is true that the caste system lends itself
readily to intolerance, that some of the most refined
and cruel forms of persecution are conducted by it
against Christians today. Yet in itself this faith has
a genius for toleration. It does not go out of its way
to attack other faiths. On the contrary it generally
reaches forward the flag of truce and peace to them.
It willingly appropriates much of their teaching and
ritual. It placed in its pantheon its arch-enemy,
Buddha, and has dignified many of the demons of
the primitive cult of South India in the same way.
And herein lie the subtle power and supreme danger
which inhere in it to other faiths.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) It must also be remembered that the faith of
India is an ethnic faith, with no ambition to reach to
other peoples beyond that peninsula. This faith has
a hundred ways of expelling and excommunicating
its members and only one doubtful door by which it
may receive outsiders, namely, by the formation of a
new caste.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christianity, on the other hand, is preëminently a
missionary religion. It claims to be the universal
faith. The last commandment of the Lord upon
earth and the first work of the Holy Spirit upon His
descent was to propagate the faith and to carry it to
many lands and peoples. Hinduism is conserved by
its social organism of caste; Christianity, by its
leavening influence upon all that comes in contact
with it, and the outreaching power of its life within.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) Another difference is observable in the fact
that while Christianity is always held as a system of
saving truth to be believed, Hinduism, in its acceptance,
does not involve the necessary belief of any
doctrine or system of doctrine. It is well understood
that a man of any belief, or of no belief, may be a
genuine and orthodox Hindu provided he observes
caste rules and ceremonies. It has been more than
once insisted upon that a man may accept Christ as
his Saviour and His religion as his firm belief and
still remain a Hindu if he only submit to the demands
of caste. Not a few Hindus are trying to live up to
this strange dual system today! And I fear some native
Christians have not got rid of the same delusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) There is also a marked difference in the moral
standards of the two faiths. In a certain sense the
moral code of Brahmanism, at its best, is lofty if not
perfect. It enjoins a man not to lie, not to steal,
not injure another, to be just, brave, hospitable and
self-controlled. Some savage races inculcate, with
more or less severity, the same moral lessons.
But to Hindus as to savages these injunctions have
represented the moral code; and whoever, among
them, attains unto these, mostly negative, virtues, is
deemed worthy of praise. In a sense the ten commandments
communicated through Moses, obtain
among Christians and are enjoined upon them today.
But they, rather than represent the Christian's
ideal, indicate only the low water mark of his moral
requirements. To say of a Christian gentleman today
that he does not steal, or does not lie, is rather
an insult than a compliment, since it assumes that he
possesses only what is now considered a very elementary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
form of morality, such as the lower classes
and children are supposed to practice. It is only as
we follow Jesus Christ and sublimate this code in
love (Matt. 22:37-40) that we rise to the full significance
and divine content of morality. The Christian
code rests not in negation, but commands a life of
outgoing, active love. A lofty altruism must permeate
his every act and give colouring to his whole
life. Christ not only introduced and emphasized this
golden rule; He taught that it was absolutely necessary
(John 12:25; Matt. 5:44).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the Hindu, on the other hand, the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lex talionis</span></span>
is a law of life still enforced. See, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Vishnu
Purana 5:19. He never thinks nor is he commanded
by his religion to think, of aught but outward conformity
to a moral code which is altogether inadequate
to keep, direct and inspire him in life. This
difficulty is, of course, enhanced when we remember
that in the whole realm of Hindu life—whether it be
of gods or of men—there is no one who looms up as
a perfect example. It is therefore little wonder that
in India today morality is at so low an ebb and that
even the code which prevails there is so sadly and
universally violated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hopkins aptly remarks in this connection: <span class="tei tei-q">“This
Christian ideal of today, which makes fair-mindedness,
liberality of thought, and altruism the respective
representatives of the savage virtues of manual
honesty, truth-speaking and hospitality, is just what
is lacking in the more primitive ideal formulated in
the code of savages and of Brahman alike....
In India all the factors of the modern code are entirely
lacking at the time when the old code was first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
completely formulated. Liberality of thought comes
in with the era of the Upanishads; but it is a restricted
freedom. Altruism is unknown to pure
Brahmanism.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering therefore these two faiths in all their
characteristics and tendencies we are warranted in
concluding that Hinduism must wane and vanish.
It is an ancient faith and has survived not a few
storms. It has a strong place in the hearts of a great
people. But the leaven of dissolution and death is
mightily at work within it today. The times are
changed, new circumstances are bringing in a revolution
of thought. Foreign ideas, language and customs
are the rage; a new civilization, the deadly foe
to the strongholds of the faith, is supplanting the
old. This faith has nothing to offer with a view to
meeting this new and complicated situation. It opposes
all progress; through its pundits and orthodox
defenders it antagonizes modern civilization and
scientific advancement at every point. It is given up
to degrading idolatry and a debasing, all-absorbing
ceremonialism. It is the foster-mother of ignorance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mighty influence of Christianity, on the other
hand, is being felt by all in the land; and the thousand-headed,
thousand-handed civilization of the
West is grasping and slowly transforming all their
ideas of life. Verily India is in the throes of a new
birth. Hinduism has done some good, doubtless.
It has had a mission in the world and that has unquestionably
been, partly, in the conservation of the
great doctrine of God's immanence at a time when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the western world had largely forgotten it. But
this work is no longer needed. Today this truth is
emphasized also by the Christian Church, and in the
safe and practical way, in combination and harmony
with the personality and fatherhood of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We can therefore look forward with confidence to
the ultimate issue of this great conflict and see,
through faith, the day when Christ shall reign supreme
in that land.

The Hindu And The Native Christian—A Study.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the many centuries of its history
and working in India Hinduism has had
ample opportunity to produce its own type
of religious devotee, one who is thoroughly representative
of its teaching and life. This type abounds
in India today and is a faithful reflection of that
faith. We shall now endeavour to study that living
embodiment of Hinduism. In one respect it will be
but another way of studying the faith itself—perhaps
the best of all methods of studying a religion, for
it is thus presented in life and action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Protestant Christianity has not been sufficiently
long in India to develop and foster an Indian type of
character of its own. And yet we see it rapidly
working towards that consummation. A century is
too brief a time for this purpose. Moreover, native
Christian life in that land is too much under the
dominance and guidance of the West to enjoy a large
degree of spontaneity; and without spontaneity life
is not natural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless, the century that has passed has
brought into existence the fourth generation of
Protestant native Christians in India; and we are
able to see, to some extent, among these descendants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of native Christians that tendency and bent which
will ere long develop into a definite and settled type
of its own. For the time being we can only study
the native Christian as a prophecy—a prophecy not
for many years to be fulfilled in all its details, and
yet worthy of study both in itself and for what it
suggests.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us consider, then, these types of the two faiths
which we see in that land.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">
<a name="toc43" id="toc43"></a>
<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">1. And First, The Hindu.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hindu Devotee is a genuine product of his religion,
wrought out during thirty centuries on its native
heath. He stands before us as a distinct type
whose characteristics differentiate him from the followers
of any other religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is well to remember here that that modern product—the
Hindu of Western culture who is so much
in evidence today in India and who sometimes
comes West in flowing orange robes and turban to
urge his mongrel philosophy upon our fellow-countrymen—is
not the type of Hindu appreciated by, or
representing, the people of that land. Neither in life
nor in teaching does he represent the faith whose
name he bears. He is a man who has studied
Western thought and religion under the guidance
and inspiration, perhaps, of the Christian missionary;
and then in an ingenious way strives to interpret his
own faith in the light of his Western attainments.
He presents to us not orthodox Hinduism, but a
mongrel doctrine and philosophy which are as foreign
to the teaching of the orthodox Hindu pundit
and as alien to the Hindu Scriptures as they are to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Western philosophy and faith. It is a significant fact
that all these Western-travelled Hindus have first to
violate a fundamental injunction of their own religion—namely,
that which prohibits sea travelling to
a Hindu—before they can visit the West in order to
commend their faith. And when they return to their
native country they do so as the outcastes of their religion,
and can be reinstated only after performing a
work of atonement which includes the disgusting
act of eating the five products of the cow!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> Hindu, who stands today as the true exponent
of his faith, is a very different man. He
would no more cross the seas than he would cut off
his right arm; for he knows that he can remain a
true Hindu only so long as he remains at home. He
is a conservative of the stiffest kind. He thinks on
ancient lines and swears by the rishis of old.
</p>


  <p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Study his prepossessions and then alone can
you appreciate his heritage. Though he may not be a
scholar or a philosopher, he is nevertheless fortified
by a host of religious beliefs and prejudices. A
thousand dogmas and prepossessions, the inherited
treasures of thirty centuries, are his. He drank them
in with his mother's milk; he has breathed them in
as an essential part of his daily environment. They
are more than second nature to him and constitute
largely the world of his thought. His ideas of God,
of himself, of sin, of salvation, of human life—all are
far removed from ours and are peculiarly his own.
He feels himself to be in the toils of an iron destiny
which slowly grinds him to powder. His conception
of God brings him no ray of comfort, or hope
of release. His idea is that his sin and suffering of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
today are the inflictions, by some unknown power,
for the sins of supposed former births. So that he
must, through countless ages, work out his own
salvation—a salvation which indeed means eternal
rest; but it is a rest from all thought, emotion, self-consciousness
and separate existence as well as from
all work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Within the mighty fascination of this Vedantism
the people have been held through the centuries.
And it is a doctrine which renders the highest morality
impossible and has proved the mightiest soporific
to the conscience. A few years ago a murderer in
South India was being led from the court of justice
to prison where, soon, he was to be executed for his
crime. As he was struggling in the street with the
police, a missionary accosted him, urging him to confess
his sin against God and to seek his peace.
Whereupon the man replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not commit the
murder; it was the work of God Himself, in whose
hands I am and of whom I am part.”</span> To this the
missionary replied that this was neither true nor
worthy, and that he would soon suffer the full
penalty of the law for his crime. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, yes,”</span> he
exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“the god who wrought this in me and
through me, will put me to death. It is all his and I
am he.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the line of thought which passes through
the mind of the orthodox Hindu devotee under all
circumstances, be they pleasant or disagreeable. And
it is one of the most difficult things for him, under
these circumstances, to cultivate a true sense of responsibility
and a genuine conception of sin as a
moral act.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) See again his ideals. He has many such which
influence him largely in his life. Much depends upon
what a man regards as the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Summum Bonum</span></span> of life.
The supreme blessing which the Hindu ever holds before
his eyes, as the highest and last attainment, is
union with God. Not a union of sympathy, but a metaphysical
oneness with Brâhm. To lose himself entirely
in the Divine Being and thus to cease having separate
thought or existence, and to pass out of the turmoil
and restlessness of human life into the calm of the
passionless bosom of the Eternal—this, to him, is
the ideal which alone is worthy of human attainment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again; we, Christians, look forward to a complete
self-realization, to a perfect manhood and a full
rounded character as our ideal. The opposite ideal
is the Hindu's. He seeks the loss of all that we hold
best—the elimination of every ambition and desire,
the eradication of all love and altruism, the cessation
of all activity—good as well as evil. His ideal is not
greatness and goodness of heart, but the renunciation
of all that animates and inspires. To him the highest
virtue in its noblest activity has no charms; for
he claims that he looks above and beyond all this to
that absolute equilibrium of soul when passion, and
when all desire, shall have been killed through self-mortification
and self-abnegation and he shall have
attained mental poise and repose rather than a perfect
character. Thus, in its last analysis, his ideal is
an intellectual, rather than a moral, one; for it is
again absorption into the Divine Soul; and that he
conceives to be the Supreme Intelligence rather than
the Perfect Will. This difference of ideal between
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the two faiths is fundamental and must work for
very diverse results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In harmony with this is the other thought that the
body, yea each and every body with which the soul
may clothe itself, is an unmitigated evil because it is
the highway to suffering and defers the final consummation.
Hence, the Hindu has no respect for
the body and longs for the day of final emancipation
from flesh and all its ills.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How then shall the soul be freed from its many
births so that it may pass out of this bondage into
the final freedom of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sayutcha</span></span>,
or emancipation? To him
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span>,
the way of meditation, represents the
highest way of release. To wean the mind, through
this process, from all desire and ambition and thus to
reach absolute equilibrium of soul is the object of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Yoga</span></span>.
This indeed is the only condition whereby
the soul can rise above any future contact with
earthly bodies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Consequently the Hindu has, for many centuries,
looked to the monastery and the wilderness as the only
places where this ideal can be safely and speedily attained.
To live among men, and thus to be subjected
to corroding cares and to the swaying passions
of human society, renders the attainment of beatification
impossible. Under these circumstances the
soul finds no way of emancipation. Therefore the
watchword of the Hindu is, <span class="tei tei-q">“flee from the world
rather than overcome it.”</span> For the attainment of
those qualities which ensure final repose he immures
himself in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mutt</span></span> or he flees into the forest where,
apart from men, he gives himself to self-mortification
and meditation that he may speedily find the desired
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
release. At the root of this idea, as its animating
motive, lies the worthy ambition of living a better
life than the environments of a corrupt society
favour. And with this desire is coupled the idea
that a full rounded life and a perfected character are
not only possible in the solitude of a wilderness but
are nowhere else attainable. And thus it is, with
many, a silent acknowledgment of failure and of the
belief that in the rush and struggle of public life
a godly, heavenly-minded character is impossible.
According to the Hindu conception, a man may be
successful in business matters, but he cannot be holy
or fit for the highest communion with God unless he
spend his time in separation from all his kind.
Therefore the so-called pious and holy men of that
land are ascetics. They eschew human society and
seek to renounce all human good and every earthly
ambition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this purpose, ostensibly, in view there are, as
we saw, about 5,500,000 men in India who have
given up all earthly employment, who live apart as
ascetics and spend their time in roaming around the
country as religious mendicants. These people are,
in the main, doubtless possessed of the laudable ambition
to be holy and to prepare themselves for union
with Brâhm. And yet, as a matter of fact, they are
the most pestilential in their morals of all the people
of the land. Many of them, at the same time, both
regard themselves and are regarded by their co-religionists
as the acme of piety. Nevertheless, they
daily trample under foot every command of the
decalogue. It is true that a few of them are different
from the mass, and genuinely seek the higher life
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the cultivation of which they have separated
themselves. But into their ideal of life altruism
hardly enters at all. It is not to do good unto others,
but to escape contamination from others which is
the concern of the Hindu devotee. At the basis of
his higher aspirations concern for self is supreme,
thoughts of others are absent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A notable illustration of a high realization of the
Eastern ideal we see in the famous Hindu ascetic
Swamiji Bhaskara Nanda Sarasvati, of Benares, who
recently died and to whom Dr. Fairbairn has referred
so cordially. For many years he had given himself
to devotion and meditation. He had subdued the
body by the rigours of asceticism and had attained
preëminence in self-restraint and in the highest wisdom
of <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">yoga</span></span> culture.
He had therefore retired from
the world, spurned all its allurements, denied all its
claims and devoted himself exclusively to thought
and meditation. Thus immured within temple walls
in the great city of Benares he was utterly oblivious
to the sin and sorrow of the swarming multitudes of
that city and did nought to relieve the suffering, or
to improve the lives, of his fellow-beings. He died,
and over his remains has been erected a shrine to
which the thousands go for worship and for inspiration
to attain unto that ideal of life which they believe
him to have realized.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This ideal has, for centuries, taken possession of
the Hindu mind, and never before did it rule with
more absolute sway than it does at present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another ideal of life with the Hindu is the so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">“path of works.”</span> At present this term is synonymous
with a life of ceremonialism. In modern parlance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“works”</span> means to the Hindu, ceremonial observance.
His life is hedged in on all sides by a host
of ceremonies and is permeated through and through
with a most complicated ritual. There is nothing in
the life of a Hindu devotee, whether it be eating,
sleeping, bathing or travelling, which is not religiously
prescribed both as to time and method. And
utterly regardless of the significance of these rites or
the appropriateness of them to his life, he deems
their observance as essential to his salvation and finds
in their daily keeping the highest satisfaction and
completest assurance of his spiritual progress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hindu is no rationalist in his religion. He
obeys implicitly, and without question, the ritual of
his ancestors and finds no interest in the scrutiny or
analysis of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So, to the ordinary Hindu, especially to him to
whom the way of meditation in the wilderness seems
impossible, ceremonialism becomes a matter of supreme
concern. No other religion has furnished to
its followers a more elaborate and pervasive system
of observances than this. These rites exercise their
influence upon the mind and are wielding today a
most potent influence upon Hindu character. A man
may think nothing of, nor have any ambition to attain
unto, the spiritual aspect of his faith; he may
give no time whatever to any of its teachings or spiritual
instruction; but if he maintain its ritual with
ordinary care he flatters himself with the thought
that he has attained a perfection corresponding to his
estate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, the Hindu is a thorough <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fatalist</span></em>. He
believes that his destiny is <span class="tei tei-q">“written upon the forehead.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Nothing which he may do can affect this
destiny. Nor does it seem to be a part of the divine
purpose. So far as he is concerned it is an irrevocable
fate. This belief manifests itself largely in his
life and conduct. It is one of the inconsistencies of
the Hindu's thinking that he, at the same time, worships
a tribal god in whose hands he believes his
affairs to be, and through whom prosperity can flow
into his life for time and eternity; and yet he holds,
with equal, yea with greater, persistence, the law of
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Karma</span></span>,
that is, the law of works, according to
which law alone future life, both to himself and to
all men, must be wrought out even to the last detail.
It is strange that a man whose pantheon is so
crowded as that of the Hindu, and who believes in
such constant divine guidance and interference,
should, also, at the same time, maintain a theory of
life which practically dispenses with all divine action
and makes human life the product of a blind and
grinding fate. Nothing is more marked as a characteristic
of Hindu thought today than a possession by
the people of these mutually conflicting and contradictory
views of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Looking at the Hindu from a social standpoint
we see him largely affected by the caste system. Not
only is his life in bondage to this system, his view of
life, too, is thoroughly coloured by his caste sentiments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just as ceremonialism covers all his personal life,
even so caste observance defines for him all his social
relations. There is not a tie or an influence which
binds man to man that is not, to the Hindu, a part
of the great and all-embracing caste system. So all-pervasive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is this social tyranny that a man dare not
withstand it; yea, more, he has learned to look at it
as the prime necessity of his social being and therefore
invariably regards it as the highest good. He
may indeed believe that, in the abstract, caste is an
evil and that it has been a curse to the people of the
land. But he nevertheless maintains that, as it is an
ancient part, and a most important part, of his ancestral
faith, it must be submitted to in all obedience
and regarded as the ideal of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bhagavad-Gita is regarded today not only as
the gem of all Hindu literature; it is also held up by
educated Hindus as the highest authority among their
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Shastras</span></span>.
Concerning caste duties this <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
Song”</span> speaks as follows:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Better to do the duty of one's caste,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Though bad and ill-performed and fraught with evil,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Than undertake the business of another,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">However good it be. For better far</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Abandon life at once than not fulfill</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">One's own appointed work; another's duty</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Brings danger to the man who meddles with it.</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Perfection is alone attained by him</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">Who swerves not from the business of his caste.”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore the Hindu has come to regard caste observance
as the supreme claim of his faith. As we
have seen, a man may believe or disbelieve any doctrine
he please; that does not affect his status as a
Hindu so long as he is loyal to caste rules and observances.
As one has aptly remarked, the seat of
other religions may be in the mind; the seat of Hinduism
is preëminently in the stomach. It is not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what he thinks but what and how and with whom
he eats that gives him his religious status.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hindu regards himself as socially devoid of
any right of initiative and choice; he has no will of
his own. His social conscience is in the keeping of
his caste. This has gained its rules from the past
and exercises no discretion or judgment of its own
in the social direction of its members; but it insists
upon implicit obedience, by every one, to past customs
which have crystallized into irrevocable laws.
And to these laws the Hindu is always and everywhere
a willing and an abject slave. To violate any
of them is, he well knows, to be recreant to his
faith and to be an outcaste among his people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) The Hindu is not strong in character, as Westerners
regard strength. As we have seen, his religion
is not favourable to the highest development of conscience.
Hence, sincerity and truthfulness are not
among his strong points. Not only does pantheism
undermine conscience, the example of the most
prominent gods of the Hindu pantheon, leads men to
prevaricate and encourages all forms of duplicity.
Under these circumstances it were strange if the
Hindu were conspicuous in honesty and in loyalty to
the truth. And in like manner he is wanting largely
in those convictions which, in the West, are so inseparably
associated with earnestness, integrity and
lofty purpose. If, to the Hindu devotee, religion is
not a system of truth to be believed and loyally followed,
but a series of ceremonies to be observed and
of caste rules to be obeyed, then loyalty to truth
becomes a very secondary matter and integrity of
mind will be regarded by him as of no great moment.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Therefore it is that hollowness is so often found at
the core of their life. Lying and stealing are all but
universal. It is said in our District in South India
that the regular price of a court witness is two annas
(four cents); and he stands ready to perjure himself
to any extent for this paltry sum. The ordinary
Hindu seems too often to have a predilection for
falsehood and uses truth with rare economy! There,
dishonesty and petty larceny are foibles too frequently
condoned because too generally practiced.
Even among the higher classes—the cultured and
élite—open-faced and open-handed frankness and
sincerity are too rare. Hypocrisy and duplicity are
too often cultivated as a fine art. It seems to be the
pride and pleasure of an Oriental to conceal his mind
and purpose and to say and do things by the greatest
indirection possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India has been extolled as a land where there is no
profanity. This is true and she should have the
credit for this abstinence. And one never feels like
giving her this credit more than when he returns
from that country to this and is compelled to endure
the coarse profanity which pervades our streets as a
terrible stench.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet one can hardly see how the Hindu could find
interest in, and a strong grip upon, profanity, so long
as the gods of his pantheon have so little of his respect
and enter so rarely into the serious compacts of
his life. Moreover it should not be forgotten that
obscenity fulfills in India the function of profanity in
the West. The bursts of passion which find expression
here through taking the name of God in vain
gain utterance there in language unspeakably bad of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the other kind. And this is only a part of the larger
subject of the prevalence of social immorality in
India—an evil which is largely fostered under the
protection of the religion of the land. When Lord
Dalhousie, the Viceroy of India, was considering an
act for the suppression of obscenity in the country,
he was compelled by Hindu sentiment to exempt all
temples and religious emblems from the operation of
the act! What better commentary could one desire
upon the source and prevalence of this vice in that
land? When such an evil is intrenched behind the
religion of the people and is symbolized and fostered
by its emblems and ceremonies—when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tasies</span></span>, or
women dedicated to the Hindu gods and temple
worship (there are 12,000 of these in South India
alone), constitute the public characters of the land—then
the hope for the purification of life is at the
lowest ebb.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is also very rare that one finds a Hindu whose
convictions and loyalty to certain beliefs are such that
he is willing to suffer in their behalf. That masculine
vigour and manly persistence under difficulty in
maintaining what he believes to be right and true is
not germane to the Hindu character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, the Hindu is strong in the so-called
passive virtues. In harmony with his religious
beliefs, patience and meekness and endurance of evil
have become second nature to him. This side of his
character has, indeed, received undue emphasis
during the many centuries of his history. He cannot
understand the rush and impatience, the push
and aggressiveness of the Westerner any more than
he of the West can understand the Hindu's cool,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quiet, patient, bearing under most trying and adverse
circumstances. He has a large lesson to teach
us in the art of self-control and in the ability to
endure with complacency evils which cannot be
remedied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus as we look at the Hindu from the various
standpoints of life and character we see how strange
a compound he is, and how unlike the man of the
West at nearly all points in our examination. He is
preëminently weak where we are strong, and he
manifests strength where we seem to need it most.
His religion has developed within him traits and tendencies
which, through these many centuries, have
wonderfully wrought in his life and character, and
have largely made him what he is today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover all this enables us to see what a serious
problem Christianity has in hand in India today,
namely the conversion of 230,000,000 people so far
removed in life and sentiment from those who have
gone to preach Christ to them. Yea, more, we have
seen what mighty influences and forces Christianity
has to overcome, what hosts of prejudices to destroy,
before she can lay her hand in power upon that
great land and claim it as her own.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">2. Let us Now Study The Native Christian.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Indian Christian, as we have seen, is a recent
product, so far as Protestant Christianity is concerned.
And yet we are glad to witness a marked
development in the life and character of those who
are connected with the Protestant missions. It is
true that fully one-half of the Christian community
there found has been connected with our faith no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more than a quarter of a century. But as we compare
these recent accessions to our faith with those
Christians of a second, third and fourth generation
we are much encouraged by the growth in Christian
character and principle which is taking place. I have
often studied these differences between the recent
convert and the Christian-born member of the community.
I have also compared those of the second,
with those of the third and fourth, generation of
Christian heritage; and I have been much encouraged
to see that our faith is adding to its power over the
life and character of the native Christian community
as the years and generations increase. And if the
work continues, with the present insistence and
vigour, it will not take many generations more before
Christianity will have become thoroughly indigenous,
because it will have developed a type of character in
that land fully in harmony with its own genius and
teaching.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is necessary, however, in considering this question,
that we remember specially that the antecedents
and the environment of the native Christian have
been entirely Hindu. His ancestral faith has coloured,
and must colour, largely his religious preceptions and
conduct. Let it not be thought that, when a man
abandons Hinduism and becomes a Christian, he
thereby, once and for all, drives out of his mind all
those prepossessions, prejudices and superstitions
which he has inherited from the past. It will take a
long time for him to separate himself from these and
their influence. Many of them will probably cling
to him during his whole life. It is as much as we
can hope that Christian truth will take increasing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possession of his mind and gradually supplant the
old and unworthy beliefs of Hinduism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are moreover certain elements of truth in
that old faith which we do not care to eliminate from
his mental furnishing, but which must find new adjustment
and be properly located in the new religion
which he has adopted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should also be remembered and made prominent
in our consideration of this subject that the people of
India are an Oriental people and are the children of
the tropics and, as such, will always remain and
must remain very different from us of the Northwest.
Their climatic and meteorological conditions, their
outer, physical life, their social customs and the
trend of their civilization, have always been, and will
continue to be, far removed from our own. Nothing
could be more fatal to our success in our effort for
the conversion of India than the idea that we must in
every respect mold them after the pattern of Western
life and habits. A large portion of their life is the
result of the conditions which I have mentioned and
must largely remain unchanged; and it would be
folly for the missionary to regard these as a part of
the faith to be supplanted, and to teach that western
social customs are inseparable from Christianity and
must be accepted by the Orient with our faith. The
Christian of India will always be, and it is well that
he should be, differentiated from the Anglo-Saxon
Christian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should also be remembered that the people of
India, at least the masses, are low in civilization. It
should not be expected that those who are in that
low estate, when they become Christians, will leap
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with one bound into the full possession of a high
civilization and be clothed upon with some of those
beauties of western life and character which we
inevitably associate with the term, <span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian
Gentleman.”</span> They, indeed, become truly and
sincerely the disciples of Christ; but they will, at the
same time, manifest some of the crudities and weaknesses
of the low social grade of which they have
been and still remain a part. They should not be
judged by standards Western or of a high civilization.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking, then, at the native Christian of India let
us have regard to his condition socially, morally,
religiously and spiritually.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Studying this product of the Christian faith in
that land from a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">social</span></em> standpoint we find encouragement.
He differs from his Hindu neighbour by a
growing freedom from the trammels of caste. He
feels, in his best moments, that caste has been and
continues to be the greatest curse of the land, that he
has been emancipated from it, and that he is ambitious
to enjoy the liberty wherewith Christ has made
him free. And yet, unfortunately, he does not remain
constantly in the possession of this sane mind.
The roots of the caste system have reached down
into the lowest depths of his being. Even at times
when he believes that he is absolutely independent
of caste considerations, there is in him a blind
persistence which clings to caste bondage. I have
often felt that Hinduism can be dispensed with by
our convert with vastly more ease in all other particulars
than in its caste feelings and affiliations.
This relic of the past clings to him with a tenacity
which is phenomenal and most sad. Though everything
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
teaches him that this caste system is the
greatest enemy of Christianity and will prevent any
one who believes and practices it from fully imbibing
the spirit of Christ; and though he aspires to be an
earnest and an efficient Christian and to love all his
brethren, this remnant of Hinduism in his heart returns
to rob him of the joys and blessings of his
Christian birthright. I have seen this frequently
disfigure what would otherwise have been a beautiful
Christian character. I have witnessed it blast the
prospects of Christian congregations dooming them
to stagnation and death. I have known it to palsy
the arm and deaden the heart of more than one
Christian worker.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is inevitable when we remember the
mighty influence and the long continued dominance
of caste in that land. But even at this point, where
the missionary finds the greatest discouragement,
there are marked signs of progress. So long as the
missionary fought this evil alone there was little hope
of success. But, during the last few years, the conscience
of the native Christian Church itself has been
roused on this question. The Indian Christian today,
as never before, has the conviction that this
caste evil saps the spiritual life of every member and
of every church which entertains it, and that it is his
supreme duty to fight it steadily in his own heart,
home and church. And there is an increasing
number, especially of the young Christians, who are
pledging themselves to an unceasing warfare against
the demon caste. Christians are also organizing themselves
into Caste Suppression Societies. All this is
highly encouraging, but needs large furtherance and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
development before the native Christian can be said
to be freed from this most subtle curse of the ancestral
faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old Hindu Joint Family System is the foster-mother
of the caste idea, and it is cheering to see
native Christians increasingly abandoning that system
for the Western idea of home which encourages
thrift, independence and liberty among the various
members of a family and clan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India, for many years to come, this blight of
social narrowness, exclusiveness and divisiveness
will affect more or less the native Christian character
and give colour to the native Christian Church. For
centuries it may prove the weak spot of Indian
Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Morally</span></em>, the native Christian develops slowly.
One writer has recently claimed that the Christian of
India manifests little, if any, preëminence over the
Hindu, in this respect. This is not true. He is certainly
moving forward and upward morally. But it
should be remembered that moral character is not one
of the first results of Christian conquest among such
a people. It is rather the highest and last fruit upon
the tree of Christian life. It should not be forgotten
that what we regard in the West as the high moral
traits of a Christian gentleman are the product of
more than 1,000 years of Christian living.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The native Christian manifests, in this respect, the
weakness of his antecedents and his environment.
When we remember that weakness of character to
which we have referred as belonging to the Hindu it
is not surprising that the native Christian, who is
daily surrounded by men of that faith and who imbibes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the atmosphere of that religion, should largely
be affected by the same evil. A few years ago an
English barrister complained to me of certain Christian
witnesses who had given evidence in a case
recently conducted by him in Madura. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hate to
have your Christians as witnesses in any of my
cases,”</span> he says; <span class="tei tei-q">“for whenever they venture to give
false evidence they instantly falter and stumble and
are caught by the opposing counsel. A Hindu, when
he gives false evidence, will tell a straight and a
plausible story. But your Christians are too much
affected by twinges of conscience.”</span> What was embarrassing
and annoying to him was encouraging to
me! That our Christians should occasionally give
false evidence did not surprise me; but that they, in
this matter, should be differentiated, by this disinterested
observer, from Hindu witnesses is a reliable
testimony in favour of their growing veracity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the higher class of native Christians, which
is annually increasing in number, there is marked improvement
in character. Especially among mission
agents do we have opportunity to witness this development.
They are growing in sincerity and reliability.
The missionary is learning, with increasing
pleasure, to place confidence in their veracity. And
yet, we must mourn that moral progress among our
people, both high and low, is not more rapid and
satisfying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Social immorality, as we have seen, is very prevalent
in that tropical country. It is natural that this
should annoy and worry us greatly among our native
Christians. It is a sad fact that more of our mission
agents are dismissed on account of this sin than any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other. Hindu society is not only largely demoralized
by this evil, there is also no public sentiment against
it. But, under the influence of a growing sentiment
in behalf of chastity and purity, the evil is gradually
diminishing among our native Christians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One source of moral depravity in Hindu society is
the prevalent belief among them that there is no
necessary connection between piety and morality.
Their faith maintains that a man may be an ardent
and worthy devotee, and at the same time trample
under foot every part of the decalogue. Indeed the
immorality of their religious ascetics is as noticeable
as their profession of piety. Nobody there questions
their lofty faith, their deep piety, their supreme devotion
to their gods; nor will any one hesitate for one
moment to charge them with every vice and sin in
the human catalogue. Such is the Hindu mind that
it can and does believe that these, to us, inseparable
elements of a noble life, can be severed and found
absolutely apart. In India, today, the moral people
are largely the non-religious; while the ostentatiously
religious are the publicly immoral ones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will take a long time for this fundamental and
universally prevailing error to lose its grip upon our
Christian people in that land. We find, not infrequently,
in the Christian community, men and
women living in unrighteousness and at the same
time believing that it will be overlooked in the Divine
account because of their zeal in Christian advocacy or
their offering for the Christian cause. Perhaps this
land of the West also is not free from such a delusion!
We endeavour to teach them, in the language
of the Apostle Paul (1 Tim. 3:9), <span class="tei tei-q">“to hold the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mystery of the faith in a pure conscience”</span>; and we
emphasize the supreme truth that faith and conscience,
piety and morality are one and inseparable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Religiously</span></em>, the native Christian is slowly
shaking off the clinging brood of superstitions which he
inherited from Hinduism. Our most recent converts
have often a tenacious belief in the efficacy of some
of those childish superstitions and charms which
were largely their main stay in their ancestral religion.
In most cases these are not a matter of faith so much
as of inheritance which have become more than a
second nature to them. Idolatry may be abandoned,
belief in Hinduism as a saving faith may be thrown
to the winds, Hindu ritual may lose its charm; but
the many little superstitions which are connected
with private life and social customs have still a quiet
influence and a lingering power over them. These
largely belong to the life of those who have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recently</span></em>
accepted the Christian faith. It may be that some of
them will never make that progress in life which will
lift them entirely above some of these Hindu superstitions.
But the great majority of native Christians
today have religiously had no connection whatever
with Hinduism and have entirely substituted Christian
rites and observances for those of the Hindu
religion. And they apparently have large satisfaction
in them. The old Hindu idea of the supreme value
of asceticism is largely yielding to a Christian altruism
which abandons self-centred, self-seeking, activity
in favour of loving sympathy for, and an
endeavour to do good to, men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We also notice that among them the idea of the
efficacy of certain forms and ceremonies is lessening
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in favour of a conviction of the power of the inner life
of faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet it should be constantly kept in mind that
ceremony and ritual must always find a larger place
in the religious life of India than in that of the United
States. The inhabitant of India is tropical and poetic
in temperament. He beholds things, and appreciates
and appropriates spiritual blessings, more through
the help of forms and ceremonies than does the man
of the West. A rite appeals to his nature more
strongly and lends to him greater facility in getting
at its underlying truth and antitype than it does to
us. Indeed it is his nature to look at Christian truth
through the eyes of a poet; and ceremonies consequently
convey to him the largest significance and
are more revealing of the spirit within. We seek
divine truth and spiritual blessings more directly than
he. It would be therefore a mistake for us to expect
that practical, unpoetic mind of ours in the Oriental,
or to present religious truth to him in its nakedness,
unadorned and unenforced by rite and ritual. It has
been, and, to some extent, continues to be the fault
of our Congregational Missions in India that they try
to lift the native Christian to those dry, unadorned,
simple forms of religious service which indeed satisfy
the missionaries, but which ignore the great difference
of nature and temperament between themselves
and the converts. It should be remembered that in
India people think vocally. Even as they must and
do read aloud in order to read intelligently, so must
they worship aloud in order to worship feelingly and
thoughtfully. Hence the wisdom and urgency for
them of a ritual and a responsive service.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spiritually</span></em>, the Indian Christian is slowly and
surely developing on definite lines of his own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The simplicity of his faith is beautiful. He has
none of those questions of doubt or misgivings of
unbelief which are so prevalent in the West. He
takes the Bible in all fullness of acceptance. His
prayers are not crossed and frustrated by any rationalistic
theories, but have the simplicity of childish
directness, filial trust and full expectancy. Nothing
has touched me more in my contact with native
Christians than to feel the directness, simplicity, unquestioning
trustfulness of their prayers even in times
of greatest adversity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The native Christian possesses a mystic temperament.
The inhabitants of that land, through many
centuries of training, have become natural mystics in
religion. This national heritage the native Christian
retains; and properly chastened and directed by
Christian truth and faith it will add depth, beauty
and power to his religious life. Under these conditions
I shall have no fear of mysticism in the Christian
Church in India. Deep spirituality and a yearning
after the hidden things of religion is more natural
to the East than to the West. The West is practical
and worldly; the East is mystical and other-worldly.
The native Christian, at his best, is manifesting some
of this spiritual power. He takes naturally to the
Pauline emphasis upon the life <span class="tei tei-q">“hid with Christ in
God,”</span> and to the mystic union which exists between
Christ and His own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is here that the native Church in India is, I believe,
to show an inspiring example to the Church of
the West. If the Christian of India is not to be as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
practical or indeed as spiritually sane as his brother
of the West, he will probably illustrate more of the
hidden mysteries and power of the spiritual life. In
this respect the spiritual power of the East and that
of the West will be, in their separate emphasis, mutually
complementary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Indian Christian, true to his native temperament,
is and will continue to be strong in the so-called
passive virtues, and weak in the positive or
aggressive ones. Patience, meekness, gentleness, endurance—these
are the graces which preëminently
adorn him and which give colour and shape to his
religious character. Here, again, his life will be very
different from that life which has characterized, thus
far, the Western Christian. The masculine virtues
of assertion, boldness, aggressiveness have characterized
the West. We have been strong and continue
strong in that aspect of our faith which we associate
with the words assertion and attack. The West has,
true to its environment and training, developed
Christian character mostly, I will not say exclusively,
on the positive side of life. The equally important
passive virtues we of the West have much neglected
if not despised as weakness. The East is even today
manifesting the blessedness, and the native
Christian will increasingly illustrate, the beauty and
potency, of the passive virtues—of the spiritual element
of endurance and non-resistance. He will
show to us that a true and perfected character—a
character molded after that of the divine Exemplar—must
have also, and with equal emphasis, the sweet
and feminine passive graces of life as an essential
element. In India today the Anglo-Saxon is wont
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to speak with contempt of <span class="tei tei-q">“The mild Hindu.”</span> That
mildness which we are too apt to despise contains
the germs of that half of Christian character which
is too largely wanting in the spiritual life of the
Anglo-Saxon and which the Christian Church of
India will increasingly illustrate and gradually seek to
respect, honour, and ultimately, to adopt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, speaking broadly of the native Christian of
India today we find him almost as much a product
of heredity and environment as he is of Christianity.
He holds out Christ before himself as his ideal of life,
and His words as the all-satisfying truth. He seeks
in His redeeming work rest and salvation of soul;
but many of the deepest yearnings of his heart
come to him through old channels worn out by his
ancestral faith. Hinduism gives more or less of
colouring to his religious thought and aspirations; and
not a few of its forms and ceremonies are retained,
but filled with a new Christian content, and are utilized
to aid in the development of Christian life.
Even as the Jews of old entered into possession and
appreciation of Christian life through Jewish rites
and ceremonies, so do native converts enter Christian
life through Hindu forms today. From the necessity
of their thought and being they utilize not a few
of the processes of the old, in order to acquire and
enjoy the blessings of the new, faith. This cannot
be avoided nor do we desire that it should be
avoided.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The study of the Indian Christian character in its
peculiarities and tendencies is of importance, because,
as I have said above, I believe it is to affect
our conceptions of life in the West. At the present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time not a few of the religious vagaries which infest
our land such as Christian Science and Theosophy,
have chiefly come to us from India. At least, whatever
of philosophy they may possess, and all of the
occultism and mysticism which they court and magnify,
are thoroughly Eastern and Indian. And from
the popularity of such movements in this land it
would seem as if the boast of some men that Hindu
thought is invading the West is partially true. But
the invasion which I desire and expect, in the not
distant future, is the invasion of an Oriental <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian</span></em>
thought, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian</span></em> life and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian</span></em> character.
This will come in its time as truly as, and much
more fully than, the other has come, and it will do
this country as much good as the other is now doing
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As an illustration of what I mean in reference to
the influence of Eastern thought upon the West I
would prophesy that ere long the Indian Christian
Church will formulate for itself and enunciate to the
world an advanced and helpful doctrine of the Holy
Ghost beyond anything that the West has enunciated.
India, which for these many centuries has been the
home of an all-prevalent spiritual pantheism, when
it comes to elaborate the doctrine of God, from a
Christian standpoint, will give as much emphasis to
His immanence as the West has given to His transcendence.
God with us and in us and working in
all creation, even the Holy Spirit of God,—this is
the conception which the Indian Christian will
elaborate and illuminate beyond anything that the
West has thus far attempted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is danger, today, and it is inevitable, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
missionaries from the West be too ambitious to occidentalize
the native Christian community, ignorant
of, or indifferent to, the grand possibilities of thought
and of life which lie in Eastern character and teaching.
It is much easier to thrust upon them everything
Western than it is to appreciate and to conserve
many things Eastern. The future missionary
will learn wisdom from the past and will enter upon
his work with less depreciation of things Oriental
and with a larger desire to conserve to the utmost
Eastern habits of thought and social customs, so long
as, and so far as, they can be made the vehicles of
Christian thought and the channels of Christian life.
Herein must lie the best means for a speedy coming
of the Kingdom of Christ in India.

The condition of its women is the truest test
of a people's civilization. Her status is her
country's barometer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The one hundred million women of India admirably
reflect the whole social and religious condition
of that land. There are more nations in India
than are found in all Europe; they also present a
greater diversity of type. Between the aboriginal
tribes which treat the weaker sex only as a beast of
burden, and the Parsee community which holds its
women in the highest consideration and furnishes
them with a liberal education and large opportunity,
there are many intermediate tribes and nations which
regard their women with varying degrees of consideration
and of contempt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of all Scriptures the Zend Avesta of the Parsees is
the only one which furnishes woman, from the beginning,
with absolute equality with man; and that
position she has never lost among the Parsees. But
the Parsees in India are a mere handful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hindu woman constitutes four-fifths of the
total number of her sex in India; and her condition
is fairly uniform everywhere and conforms, in varying
degrees, to a type whose characteristics are easily
recognized. She has come down from earliest history.
We recognize her everywhere in the pages of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their ancient literature, in their laws and legends; and
we behold her in all the manifold walks of modern
life. For nearly a quarter of a century the writer has
lived as her neighbour, gazed daily upon her life,
wondered at and admired her many noble traits
which have been preserved under the most adverse
circumstances, and grieved over her weakness and
her many disabilities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In ancient times, the position of woman in India
was one of power coupled with honour. Today
the power remains, but the honour has been largely
eliminated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. In ancient Vedic times woman enjoyed many
distinctions and revealed great aptitude. She joined
her husband in the offering of domestic sacrifices
and sat as queen in the home. Some of the sacred
hymns of the Rigveda were made by her and have
come down these thirty centuries as a beautiful testimony
to her intellectual brightness and aspiration, and
as an evidence of the honour in which she was held.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Five centuries later this beautiful description was
given of her in the Mahabarata:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rights and opportunities of woman are strikingly
illustrated by many of the legends of their
ancient epics. For instance, we read of the
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Svayamvara</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the lovely princess Draupadi. It was the
occasion when she had attained womanhood and
was entitled to the right to choose her own husband.
How graphically are the royal suitors described as
they press their claims to her heart and hand in
knightly tournament. It is one of those scenes
which reveal woman in the possession of some of
her most queenly rights and attractions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient ideals of womanly character have come
down the centuries writ large in their songs and
annals; and these ideals are today held as dearly,
and are loved and sung with as much ardour, as at
any time in the history of India.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every boy and girl of that land, today, knows the
lovely Sita, wife of the noble and heroic Rama,—how,

and faithfulness to her royal lord.

Who does not know of the faithful Saguntala,

Goethe.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India has always boasted of the constancy and devotion

was finally restored to her in youthful vigour.

These are some of the stock illustrations of the
model wife used everywhere and at all times in
India. And they have had an extensive and wonderful
influence in the molding of wifely ideals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, as we see, a glorification of devotion, faithfulness,
constancy—traits that have always beautified
the character of the Hindu woman. It is true that,
apart from her husband and from the kitchen, woman
has had few ideals urged upon her in that great country.
Her ambitions have not crossed the doorsteps
of her house and home. She is measured entirely by
her relation to her husband or children. She is her
lord's companion and servant. Love to him is the
wand which alone can transform her life into gold.
Her usefulness and her glory are the reflections of
his pleasure and of his satisfaction in her. She has
no separate existence. Apart from man, she is an
absolute nonentity. And yet, within the sphere
which has been granted to her, she has shone with a
wonderful radiance and with a charm which reminds
us often of some of Shakespeare's beautiful
womanly creations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The physical attractions of woman have always,
of course, captivated the sterner sex in India, as in
other lands. Her beauty is lavishly described and
painted in warm colours through all Hindu literature.
And she <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> physically beautiful; she will compare
favourably with the fair ones of any land in womanly
grace, in beauty of figure, and in bewitching charm
of manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the standard of womanly grace and beauty is
not precisely the same there as it is with us in the
West. A Hindu and an American have different
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ideals of personal beauty. Though the Aryan type
of countenance may not largely differ East and
West, there are touches of expression and shades of
beauty which correspond respectively to the different
ideals in both lands. May they not have created the
ideals themselves?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most common results of a Hindu woman's toilet
are the smooth hair, the blackened eyebrow, the
reddened finger-nails, the pendent nose jewels, the
bulky ear-rings, the heavy bangles for ankles and
arms. Without these, life, to the Hindu belle, is not
worth living. On wedding occasions, among the
common folk, red ochre is also daubed over the
throat in ghastly suggestion to the Westerner; but
in glorious attractiveness to the native of the land!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
West and East associate a fair complexion with
highest beauty. A fond Hindu mother once came to
the writer moaning that she could not find a husband
for her daughter because she was <span class="tei tei-q">“too black!”</span> The
young man of India puts a premium upon every
shade of added lightness of complexion. His taste
is reflected in the universal feminine custom of using
saffron dye to lighten the complexion upon all
festive occasions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The clothing of the woman of India is exceedingly
attractive. Her pretty garb sets off admirably the
beauty of her person; and, both in inexpensiveness
and grace, and in its contribution to health, is far better
than the complicated extravagance, the heavy
encumbrance and the insanitary tight-lacing of the
West. The women of South India dress with a view
to comfort in the tropics; but they have also, in a
most remarkable degree, conserved appropriateness,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
beauty, and simplicity in their robes. The possibilities
of the one cloth, which is the full dress of the South
Indian woman, as a modest garment and as a charming
full-dress equipment would be a revelation to the
much dressed votary of the West. In the arranging
of this cloth there is considerable scope for ingenuity
and for æsthetic taste; although, in this matter, the
rules of each caste furnish an iron etiquette which
must be followed by the women. Indeed, the
tyranny of Worth in the West is nothing as compared
with caste tyranny as the Fashioner of the East.
This is accounted for by the fact that a woman's
dress must be arranged in such a way as to publish
abroad her caste affiliations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Woman has a vast influence upon the life of the
people of India. In no other country has she relatively
exercised more power. All this, notwithstanding
the fact that, for more than twenty centuries,
she has had no recognized position in religion
or in society. Her spiritual destiny has been entirely
in the hands of man. By the highest authorities her
salvation has been made entirely dependent upon her
connection with him. She has absolutely no right
of worship of her own. From the cradle to the
grave she is in man's keeping. Until she is married,
supreme obedience to her father is her only safety;
while her husband lives, heaven's blessings can come
to her only through his favour and prayer; and, after
his death, her sons become her lords and the sole
guardians and protectors of her spiritual interests.
All this is everywhere recognized by Hindu society,
and by none more than by the woman herself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, it is equally true, and a fact of remarkable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
significance, that, in India today, the religious
influence of woman is paramount. She is the stronghold
of Hinduism at the beginning of this twentieth
century. Man, under the growing influence of
western thought, civilization, and faith, has largely
lost his moorings and is growing increasingly insincere
and a trifler with religious beliefs and institutions.
The woman, on the other hand, is a conservative
of the conservatives. In her superstition
she is deeply sincere; her faith has no questionings,
and her piety shapes her every activity. Were it not
for the women of India, Hinduism, with all its
vaunted philosophy, its wonderful ritual and its
mighty caste tyranny, would, within a decade, fall
into <span class="tei tei-q">“innocuous desuetude.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a significant fact that in the religion of no
other people on earth does the worship of the female
find so prominent a place. In many parts of the
land <span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">Sakti</span></span>
worship, or the worship of goddesses, is
widely prevalent and almost paramount in influence.
It is really the worship of power under a female
form; and the power which these goddesses exercise
is mostly malevolent in its character. The terrible
wife of Siva, in all her dread manifestations, is the
most popular deity, because the most feared in the
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is natural to inquire whether this characteristic
of the Hindu pantheon is not a reflection of the Hindu
mind as to the influence of woman, and as to the
belief of man in the evil character of that influence.
As is the place and power of woman among the men
so is the character and place of the goddesses in the
pantheon of that people.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The famous religious reformer Chunder Sen,
though he adopted and used the Lord's Prayer,
changed the form of address from the masculine to
the feminine and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Mother who art in
heaven!”</span> The adoration of the female in Hindu
worship was never more marked than at present.
What has Christianity to meet this bent of the Hindu
mind? Or should it be discouraged as an element in
worship? The Romanists meet it by exalting and
giving preëminence to the Virgin Mother. The
Protestants have nothing corresponding to this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Socially, the Hindu woman is a reactionary of the
most pronounced type; she opposes social reform at
all points—nowhere more than when it is directed to
ameliorate her own condition. Religiously, as we
have seen, she is the slave of man by law and teaching;
yet she rules her household, even in these matters,
with an iron hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From her throne in the home she so wields her
sceptre that it is felt also throughout the whole social
fabric. Her beloved lord has perhaps passed through a
university course, is a pronounced social reformer and
discourses in eloquent English, before large audiences
of his admiring countrymen, concerning the mighty
social evils which are the curse of the country; he,
with his ardent fellow-reformers, frames rules which
shall soon usher in the millennium of social reform
and progress! And then he—this man of culture, of
eloquence, of noble purposes and of altruistic ambitions—goes
to his home and meekly submits to the
grandmotherly tyranny which has shaped his life
much more than he knows, and which vitiates and
renders nugatory all his social and other schemes!
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
As man has narrowed the scope of woman's life in
that land, so she has given it intensity of power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And what is more significant, she has become supremely
contented with the narrow sphere which
man has grudgingly given her. And, for this very
reason, she combats every endeavour, on the part of
her friends, to release her from her bondage and to
increase her opportunities and blessings in life. The
old triple slander perpetrated upon India, to the effect
that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a country in which the women never
laugh, the birds never sing and the flowers have no
fragrance,”</span> is a falsehood in all its details. Hindu
women have as merry a laugh as their sisters in any
other land. They have learned to make the best of
their lot and to rejoice in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the time of the Mohammedan conquest, and
probably long before, the higher class of women
have mostly led a life of seclusion. This is preëminently
true of the northern parts of the country
where Mohammedan influence was strongest and the
Hindu had carefully to protect his wife and daughters
from the coarse Mussulman. In South India this
seclusion is very rare and observed only among the
most aristocratic. The common woman of India
finds ample freedom of intercourse in her town and
village, and figures conspicuously at the great religious
festivals of her land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Generally speaking, woman is the redeeming feature
of India. She is the ideal home-keeper and
housekeeper. Usually, she is devoted to her husband,
a passionate lover of her children, the conserver
of society, the true devotee in religion. Her lord and
husband has been taught, from time immemorial, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
keep her in obscurity and to surround her with the
screen of ignorance and narrow sympathies; but she
has magnified the work assigned to her; her excellence
has shown far beyond his; and, in her bondage,
she has built her throne from which she has wielded
her sceptre of love and goodness over him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She has never aspired to realms not granted to her
by her lawgivers. The modern aspiration of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“new woman”</span> of the West does not appeal to her.
She asks only to be let alone in her narrow but, to
her, all-sufficient sphere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But, after all we have said, or can say, of the
power of woman in India, it still remains that, in no
other land, has she suffered such marked disability
and deeper injustice. If her goodness has shone out
of her darkness, it has only served to reveal the more
the sadness of her position. She bears in her condition
the signs of her bondage and humiliation. The
evils of the land have been attributed to her; and
man too often ascribes his own degradation and sin
to the curse breathed upon him by woman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The proverbs of a country are the truest test of its
sentiments. What have these to say of the woman
of India today?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What poison is that which appears like nectar?
Woman.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is the chief gate to hell? Woman.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is cruel? The heart of a viper. What is
more cruel? The heart of a woman. What is the
most cruel of all? The heart of a soulless, penniless
widow.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is a fool who considers his wife as his
friend.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Educating a woman is like putting a knife in the
hands of a monkey.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are a few of the many proverbs which characterize
woman in one vernacular only. Every other
Indian tongue equally abounds in proverbial expressions
which brand a woman as one of the greatest
evils of the land. Sanskrit writers have exhausted
vituperative language in describing woman. They
represent her as <span class="tei tei-q">“wily, hypocritical, lying, deceptive,
artful, fickle, freakish, vindictive, vicious, lazy,
vain, dissolute, hard-hearted, sinful, petty-minded,
jealous, addicted to simulation and dissimulation.
She is worse than the worst of animals, more poisonous
than the poison of vipers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These proverbs do not necessarily reveal the depravity
of the Hindu woman; but they do testify
unmistakably to the estimation in which she is held
by man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ignorance of woman there is dense and is
probably a fact which closely connects her with the
proverbial expressions concerning her. Her illiteracy
is not an incident in Indian life. It has been, through
the centuries, a settled policy of the land. At the
present time only one woman in two hundred can
read and write in that land of progress. The remarkable
thing is, not that so many are illiterate, but
that even a few have been taught at all, in view of
the attitude of the Hindu mind towards her. In ancient
times there was little to learn, in India, apart
from religion; but it has been the strict injunction of
their Shastras and religious instructors that no man
shall, under penalty of hell, teach to his wife or
daughter the Vedas which are the purest and best
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
part of Hindu Scriptures. Any form of useful knowledge
was considered dangerous in her possession.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not that woman is wanting in capacity. She
is as bright and as teachable as her brother. All that
she has needed, educationally, has been opportunity;
and this, society has denied her, and this has done
injustice not only to her but, still more, to itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Infant marriage has been, for many centuries, a
crying evil in that land. This has brought to woman
a train of evils which have made deplorable her condition
above all the women of the earth. This custom
originated, probably, from a sense of kindness to the
girl herself. It was the expression of a desire on the
part of the parents to insure their daughter, at an
early date, against failure to attain that which all
Hindus regard as the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span> of a woman's
life—marriage. But, in their short-sighted policy,
they failed to realize the myriad evils which would
follow this pernicious custom. The girl's will or
desire must not be regarded as an element in this
life compact! And, what is worse still, these infant
compacts are necessarily followed by early consummation,
whereby girls enter, in many cases,
upon the duties of motherhood at twelve years of
age. Few, indeed, are permitted to reach full physical
development before they assume the function of
child-bearing. This is not only a serious evil to the
woman herself, it also gives poor chance for the
begetting of a healthy progeny and for the early
training of the same. And it is not strange that the
woman who thus early enters the sphere of motherhood
should become a worn out old woman at thirty-five
or forty years.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Much effort has been put forth in India, by Westerners
especially, to make infant marriages impossible,
or at least unpopular. But, little success has
thus far attended this effort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A small meed of alleviation was gained with much
effort in 1891. It came through the passing of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Age of Consent Bill”</span> whereby the age of a girl's
consent to cohabitation was raised from ten to
twelve. To a Westerner, the blessing acquired by
this bill seems in itself a mockery and only reveals
the appalling cruelty of that people to its girls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been found impossible to touch, much less
remove, the gross evil of infant marriage itself, the
custom which opens wide the door to other ghastly
evils.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The greatest of these is that of virgin-widowhood.
If men will perversely marry their infant daughters
to small boys, it is sure that a considerable proportion
of the boys will die before their marriage is consummated.
Thus, annually, thousands of these poor
girls, who are in absolute ignorance of the situation,
are converted into virgin widows whose condition,
upon the death of their husbands, is instantly changed
from one of innocent childhood pleasure into a sad,
despised and hated widowhood. For, the parents
of the boy sincerely believe that it is her evil star
which has killed the boy whose destiny was blended
with her own. And henceforth she is regarded, not
only by the parents concerned, but by society in
general, as an accursed person, hated for what has
happened to her husband, and also a creature to be
shunned. Her presence must not be allowed on any
festive occasion, lest its evil influence bring sorrow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and death to others. Thus a child of four or five
years may suddenly have her prospects blasted, her
life embittered and her company shunned by the
whole world, with none to befriend, to cheer or to
comfort her. There are two millions of such sad
and injured ones in India today. Their cry goes up
to God and to man in inarticulate appeal for relief and
redress against a social custom and a religious rule
which consigns them, in their time of greatest innocency,
to a life which is worse than death itself and
which robs them of the protection, love and sympathy
which the whole economy of heaven and earth
should guarantee to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Coupled with this terrible fact is the other, that
woman <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> marry in India <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anyhow</span></em>. No disgrace
and misfortune can befall a woman, according to
Hindu ideas, equal to that of spending her whole life
in maidenhood. This, of course, is connected with
the idea that she has no social status or religious
destiny apart from man. Hence it is that a host of
loving parents, who are unable to find a suitable
match for their daughters, rather than leave them
unmarried, stupidly join them in wedlock to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">professional</span></em>
bridegrooms. There is, in Bengal, today, a
division of the Brahman caste whose men are professional
purveyors to this silly but prevalent superstition.
They are prepared to marry any number of
girls at remunerative rates. And thus they acquire a
fair income. Each of these men have scores of such
wives and entertains the proud satisfaction, doubtless,
that he is bestowing a favour upon a benighted
community by coupling his name in wedlock with
unfortunate girls who otherwise would be without a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
name or hope among men! A state of society which
renders such a condition of things possible is not
only a disgrace to any community, it is a monstrous
evil against the womanhood of that community. Is it
any wonder, then, that so many of the women of
India, under these circumstances, should commit
suicide? Is it strange that a wife, in such a land, should
find it best to obey and submit to the indignities of the
worst kind from her husband? And is it remarkable
that the Hindu widow, rather than endure the neglect,
the temptations and the obloquy of her widowhood,
should have preferred to practice Suttee and to end
her miseries upon the funeral pyre of her husband?
When we remember that their system consigns one-fifth
of all the women of India—more than 20,000,000
souls—to this despised and ostracized widow class,
we realize the depth of evil which flows from the
system.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is still another cruel injustice inflicted upon
the womanhood of India. Many thousands (there
are 12,000 in South India alone) of her daughters are
dedicated in infancy to a life of shame in connection
with temple worship in that land. These women,
the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“servants of the gods,”</span> have been
mostly dedicated by fond mothers to this wretched
life as a thank offering to the gods for blessings received.
This seems very strange when it is known
that all such girls thereby become public characters.
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Dancing Girl”</span> of India is thus shut up to her
evil life by those who love her most; and her religious
profession becomes to her the highway to perdition
and a bitter curse to society. Recent effort has
been made, in Bombay, to save such girls by making
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it a legal offence to <span class="tei tei-q">“marry”</span> them to the gods and
thus devoting them to a life of shame. But this law
only refers to the dedication of girls of tender age in
Bombay. It is exceedingly sad that, practically, the
whole population is utterly indifferent to this greatest
insult committed against the womanhood of India
and to the coupling of their own religion and their
gods with the ruin of the soul and body of many
thousands of the daughters of the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not remarkable, under these circumstances,
that among all the people of India the birth of a
daughter is the most unwelcome of domestic events.
The evils which surely await her, and the greater
possibilities of sorrow and suffering which surround
her, the great burden of expense and of trouble
which her training, and especially her marriage, will
entail upon the family—all combine to make her
birth a much dreaded event.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The large expense, in the shape of the marriage
dowry and the wedding expenses which have to be
incurred among nearly all classes in connection with
the disposal of their daughters, only make this situation
the more emphatic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The practice of infanticide, so extensively found
in India, was the direct result of this difficulty.
For instance, among the noble race of Rajputs
in North India it was found, some years ago,
that, in a community of 30,000, there was not a
single girl! Every daughter that was born was
killed. The higher the rank of the family the more
constant and systematic was the crime. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus,
while an unmarried daughter in India is looked upon
as hopelessly disgraced, a son-in-law cannot always
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be found unless the father of the girl is prepared to
pay highly, and the marriage of a daughter may
mean the ruin of a family. Rather than incur this
danger, the Rajput preferred that his daughter should
perish. And though the government has enacted
stringent laws against this custom, it is not entirely
eradicated yet.”</span><a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the Hindus have wittingly and unwittingly
placed many of the most serious disabilities of life
upon their women. And the greatest evil of it is
that the woman has become so hardened to her lot
that, like the prisoner of Chillon, she has become
enamoured of her chains and is most loathe to part
with her bondage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. But the dawn of a new day has risen upon
India. It is the day of woman's emancipation. A
new spirit, during the past century, has entered that
land, and the welcome era of brighter blessing, greater
appreciation and larger opportunity for woman has
actually begun. One has only to study the laws
which, during the nineteenth century, were enacted
in India with a view to removing the terrible evils
and crimes which were committed under the sanction
of Hinduism; and he will find that not a few are
directed towards the amelioration of the condition of
woman. Such inhuman customs as
<span lang="sa" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sa"><span style="font-style: italic">suttee</span></span>, the murder
of children, the dedication of girls to lives of
shame—these have been removed in whole or in
part; and, by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Age of Consent Bill”</span> and other
similar half measures, the beginning has been made
in introducing a day of better things for the women.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of the efforts of Hindu Social Reformers are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
directed towards the removal of some of the disabilities
under which woman lives. It is true that the
woman of India cannot expect, for a long time, much
help from her own people. Even the Social Reformers
among them are so few in number, are so half-hearted
in their measures, and are so unwilling to
deny themselves in behalf of the cause which they
advocate, that little can be expected from them.
And yet, it must be said that in a few matters of importance
Hindu sentiment is slowly moving in the
right direction. As a Social Reformer, the Hindu is
a poor success; but he is not a fool; he can see that
the situation, so far as woman is concerned, is becoming
increasingly untenable and flagrantly inconsistent
with the growing light of today. The hope
is that he will yield, with increasing readiness, to the
pressure brought to bear upon him by Western sentiment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The presence of many women of the West in that
land has been a standing rebuke to the Hindu social
situation. These women have done not a little to
stir within their Eastern sisters a desire for something
better. They open their eyes to the contrasted
conditions of the women of the East and of the
West. When they shall have aroused the women of
India to the desperateness of their condition and to
the urgent need of reform and relief, the battle will
be more than half fought and victory will be in view.
For, when the Eastern woman herself will vigorously
demand her emancipation, man will yield it to her.
The Dufferin Hospitals are a noble tribute to the
active interest of the good lady whose name they
bear; and the sympathetic endeavour of Lady Curzon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the elevation of India's women are but suggestive
of considerable work which the fair sex of the West
have rendered and are rendering in behalf of their
Indian sisters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Protestant Christian missions have been pioneers
in this great movement towards the emancipation of
the women of India. American and English women,
connected with these missions, have given themselves
to the redemption of their sisters. More than
one thousand of these good women are devoting
their lives to the salvation of India through the elevation
of the women of the land. Thousands of
schools are conducted by them in which a host of
young girls are receiving that training which Hinduism
has proscribed for many centuries. And through
these schools, and by means of at least two thousand
Bible Women, trained by them, they have access into
hundreds of thousands of Hindu homes where they
reveal to the women and girls a broader horizon of
life and give a new conception of the privileges and
opportunities which are opening today before them.
They are creating among the women a spirit of unrest
which is the dawning of a new ambition for
greater things in life and service. The very presence
of these foreign ladies suggests to their Indian sister
a new sphere broader than the home, and a new opportunity
pregnant with rich blessings to the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the influence of these missionary efforts and
of the less thorough training given in government
schools, Hindus themselves are beginning to bestir
themselves and to establish schools for their daughters;
and thus we trust that coming years will not
only witness a change of thought among Hindus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concerning women, but also a new line of indigenous
activity for their elevation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is further ground for encouragement; for
the Hindu man of culture is growing increasingly
sensitive to the wide gulf which lies between him and
his absolutely untrained wife. He sees that, while
the Western woman is suited in every way to become
the companion of, and a helpmeet to, her
husband, his own little wife is fit to be neither.
Even when not separated from him by a disparity of
many years in age, he finds that she has absolutely
no interest outside the walls of her home and has
not the first qualification to discuss with him or to
help him by advice in any matter pertaining to his
work or profession. So he, under the new light of
modern times, is increasingly ambitious to have a
wife of the new training and of the larger horizon,
and is willing to pay a premium for her in marriage.
And this, itself, is beginning to create a market for
educated women even in that stronghold of conservatism,
the Brahman caste.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the effort of Christian missions in the development
of womanhood is acting like leaven upon the
whole social mass.

exalts St. Thomas to a high place as the Patron Saint
and Apostle of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Careful historical investigation entirely overthrows
this old claim. The Thomas legends probably owe
their existence to the natural desire of the Syrian
Christians to connect their history with Apostolic
origin and sanction. The name may also be confounded
with a later Thomas, several of whom were
conspicuous in the annals of the India Syrian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient vagueness of the name <span class="tei tei-q">“India,”</span> has
also, doubtless, had no little influence in the formation
of these legends. In the beginning of the
Christian era <span class="tei tei-q">“India”</span> was a term of much wider
application than at present. It included several
countries in Southwestern Asia, and even a portion
of Africa. While St. Thomas may therefore have
laboured and died in <span class="tei tei-q">“India,”</span> it does not at all follow
that his field of labour was within the limits of the
peninsula now called by that name. Indeed, many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
historical incidents and facts agree in disproving
Apostolic connection with the rise of Christianity in
India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pantænus, the saintly and learned Presbyter and
Christian philosopher of Alexandria and the renowned
teacher of the illustrious church fathers,
Clement and Origen, is the first honoured name which
finds historic sanction in the grand roll of Christian
missionaries to India. He visited Malabar, South India,
during the last decade of the second century.
He was a man wonderfully equipped by deep spiritual
insight and piety and also by philosophic training
and metaphysical acumen to become the messenger
of Christian truth and life to the Buddhists and
Brahmans who lived side by side in South India in
those days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We know little of his work in that land. He
found in Malabar a colony of Jewish Christians who
possessed a copy of the Gospel of Matthew in the
Hebrew tongue, said to have been given to them by
the Apostle Bartholomew. It is not known, however,
whether this last named apostle laboured among
these Christians in that region.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Probably a century later that Christian community
formed connection with Antioch, Syria, which was
the first of all Christian missionary centres; but which,
through its Nestorian faith, soon lost its missionary
ardour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. And thus emerges out of the darkness into its
long and unique history the Syrian Church of Malabar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has passed through many vicissitudes and has
lost much, if not all, of its positive Christian influence
and missionary character. During a recent visit to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that region I was saddened by the sight of this Christian
community which had lived all these centuries in
the centre of a heathen district with apparently no
concern for the religious condition of the surrounding,
non-Christian, masses—content to be as a separate
caste without religious influence upon, or ambition to
bring Christ into the life of, its benighted neighbours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This church has survived its own apathy, on the
one side, and Roman Catholic inquisition on the
other, and appears before the world as what it really
is—the only indigenous Christian Church in the peninsula
of India. It enjoys the unique distinction of
having lived more than a millennium and a half in a
heathen land, for a thousand years of which it was
entirely surrounded by a non-Christian people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the last half century it has been considerably
influenced by the work and example of the
Church Missionary Society which is established in
that region. Through this influence a Reformed
Syrian Church has come into existence which promises
to do much for the whole community in ideals
and life. The Syrian Church has hitherto been
greatly cursed with the trinity of evils—ignorance,
ceremonialism and superstition. It was not until
1811 (at the suggestion of an Englishman) that it
translated a part of the Bible (the four gospels) into
the vernacular. And this is the only translation of
the Scriptures ever made and published by the natives
of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Syrian Church now numbers 248,741. That
part of the Syrian community which the Romish
Church compelled, by the inquisition, to unite with
it numbers 322,586.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

2. From the fourteenth century the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roman Catholic
Church</span></span> has continued to send out her emissaries
and missionaries to that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jordanus and his brave band of missionary associates
were her first representatives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was only from the arrival of Vasco da Gama
and the Portuguese conquest four centuries ago, that
the influence of that Church began to be seriously
felt and its triumphs recorded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the sword and cruel Inquisition not only were
Syrian Christians compelled to transfer their allegiance
to the Pope; non-Christians also were, for
perhaps the second time in the long history of the
land, subjected to the bitter restraints and inhuman
inflictions of religious persecution. It is a curious
fact that the hideous and bloody monster of religious
intolerance was hardly known in India until, first, the
followers of Mohammed and, secondly, the disciples
of the meek and lowly Jesus began to invade the
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then follow the devoted and heroic labours of the
saintly Xavier. He was a man of princely extraction,
of royal bearing, of Christian devotion and self-denial.
He wrought, according to his light, with
supreme loyalty to his Lord and with a divine passion
for souls in South India. Many thousands of the poor
fishermen on the coast was he permitted to baptize
into the Christian faith. It is much to be regretted
that, like nearly all subsequent Romish missionaries,
he gave himself, all but exclusively, to the ceremonial
salvation, rather than to the ethical transformation
and the spiritual regeneration, of the
people. It has always been a much easier thing, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
India, to gather the people for the reception of the
mystical ordinances of our faith than it has been to
prepare them, by patient teaching and guidance, to
exemplify its precepts by their lives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After Xavier came the accomplished and wily
Jesuit, Robert de Nobilibus—the nephew of Cardinal
Bellarmine. A believer in the Jesuitical principle that
the end justifies the means, and ardently desiring to
bring the Brahmans over to his faith he proclaimed
himself, and in every way assumed the rôle of, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Western Brahman.”</span> He lived scrupulously as a
member of that haughty caste and, until recalled by
the Pope on account of his deception, wielded much
influence over the Brahmanical hierarchy in Madura.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Men of great power and supreme devotion to their
faith followed as representatives of that great Church
in India. Such names as de Britto, Beschi, the Abbe
du Bois are a crown of honour to that community.
Many like them spent lives of great self-denial for
the cause of Christ and faithfully wrought for the
redemption of the people; so that at present the
power of the Romish Church and the devoted energy
of its leaders are known in every section of the
Peninsula. After nearly six centuries of effort its
community in India has reached the total of 1,524,000
souls. For a long time, it has not enjoyed much increase
in its membership. In many places it finds
numerous accessions; but not a few of its people
backslide and return to their ancestral faith. The
marked defects of Romanism in that land have been
its concessions to, and compromise with, the religion
of the land both on the side of idolatrous worship
and of caste observance. I have discussed the subject
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Indian Roman Catholics in the villages and
find that to them the worship of saints, through their
many obtrusive images, is practically the same as the
idolatry of the Hindus—the only marked difference
being in the greater size of the Romish images! In
like manner the Jesuit has adopted and incorporated
into his religion, for the people of that land, the
Hindu caste system with all its hideous unchristian
divisions. All this makes the bridge which separates
Hinduism from Roman Catholic Christianity a very
narrow one; and it reduces to a minimum the process
of <span class="tei tei-q">“conversion”</span> from the former faith to the
latter. But an easy path from Hinduism to Christianity
means an equally facile way of return to the
ancestral faith. If the Hindu has little to surrender
in becoming a Christian, neither has such a Christian
any serious obstacle to prevent his return to Hindu
gods and ceremonies when it suits his convenience
to do so. Hence it is that the new accessions to
Romanism hardly exceed the number of those who
leave it in order to resume their allegiance to the
faith of their fathers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Protestant missionary effort</span></span> began late. In
India it was introduced with the Dutch conquest in
the early part of the seventeenth century. But the
proselytizing methods of the Dutch in those days
savoured too much of the Romish inquisition under
the Portuguese. When the pressure of religious
compulsion by the civil government was removed,
consequent upon the English conquest in Ceylon and
India, the people apostatized in a body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) It was not until the truly Christian King,
Frederick IV. of Denmark, took, himself, a religious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
interest in that land at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, and sent, at his own expense, the first two
Protestant missionaries to Tranquebar on the east
coast, that really consistent Protestant effort for the
redemption of India began.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Zeigenbalg and Plutschau, the two pioneers who
were sent to Tranquebar, arrived in 1706. They
inaugurated the great work of Protestant Christianity
for the spiritual regeneration of India, and will
always find an honoured place among the heroes of
the cross.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Zeigenbalg was a man of great piety and of intellectual
resources. He died in 1719 after a most successful
service of unremitting toil. He gathered
hundreds of converts into the Christian fold, established
schools and erected a beautiful church edifice
which stands today as the oldest Protestant Mission
Church in the East. Above all, he felt that an open
Bible in the vernacular was essential to the conversion
of India; and he therefore gave himself to the translation
of God's Word. He was not able to complete
this work; it did not issue from the press until 1725.
This Tamil version of the Bible was the first translation
of God's Word in India and in all the East; and
it stands today as a monument to his intelligent
labours and to those of his worthy successor, Schultze.
It also represents the beginning of a new era of missionary
effort in the country. The Roman Catholics,
during all their stay in that land have done nothing
towards giving to the people the Bible in their native
tongue. It was not until the year 1857 that, stirred
by Protestant example, they published their first and
only translation of any portion of God's Word in any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the South India vernaculars—that of the Tamil
Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Schultze spent fifteen years in Madras and left a
congregation of 700 persons there. From Tranquebar,
as a centre, missionary effort spread extensively
throughout the Madras Presidency. This was done
through German missionaries supported mainly by
English funds furnished by the Society for the Propagation
of Christian Knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the most commanding figure connected
with that work and century was Frederick Schwartz,
the missionary statesman and apostle who arrived in
India in 1750. His efforts extended throughout the
Kingdom of Tanjore and even to the Madura and
Tinnevelly districts. Through all these regions his
power was felt and, in company with a few other
worthy souls, he laboured with distinguished faith,
wisdom and heroism. The Protestant Native Church
which has so flourished in Tinnevelly and Madura
found its origin and first success under his guidance.
He spent forty-eight years in unremitting effort, influenced
powerfully all missionaries who came in
contact with him, and passed on to his reward in
1798.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, before the close of the last century, at least
50,000 Tamilians had been baptized in connection
with this Protestant effort. When we bear in mind
the fewness of the agents, and the very limited
tract of country which they occupied, it is a matter
of considerable astonishment that so many converts
were every year baptized in the various missions.
In Tranquebar alone, in nineteen years, there were
19,340 persons baptized; and during the century, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entire number of converts was nearly, if not quite,
double this amount. In Madras, as many as 4,000
natives were received into the Christian church. The
Cuddalore Mission, notwithstanding its great troubles,
yielded between 1,000 and 2,000 converts; the Trichinopoly
Mission, more than 2,000; the Tanjore Mission,
about 1,500; and the mission established at
Palamcottah in Tinnevelly in 1785, also a few.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to know exactly the number of the
native Protestant Christian churches and congregations
existing at the beginning of the last century, or
the number of the Christian community in the Presidency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Probably only a few thousand remained to await
the dawn of the new century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From Madras, down South as far as Palamcottah,
infant Christian communities existed. But they did
not largely flourish until new missionary societies
were organized and a larger force of missionary
workers were sent to strengthen and push forward
the work established.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And it is very unfortunate that, with much good,
not a little evil was found among these few Christians
whom the eighteenth century bestowed upon
the nineteenth. Mr. Sherring truly says,—<span class="tei tei-q">“That
many of the converts were sincere and genuine, we
cannot doubt. Yet it is certain that the permission
to retain their caste customs and prejudices throws
considerable suspicion on the spiritual work accomplished
among them. The Danish and German missionaries
soon perceived the formidable influence of
caste as an opponent of the Gospel, unless they were
ready, like the Roman Catholics, to enlist it on their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
side, by permitting it to be retained in the Christian
churches established by them. They chose to make
caste a friend rather than an enemy. In doing this,
however, while they made their path easier, they
sacrificed their principles. They admitted an element
into their midst which acted on the Christian community
like poison.”</span> And this poison is still exercising
a potent influence upon a no small portion of
the Protestant Native Church in South India. A bad
beginning in this respect has facilitated an evil continuance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The closing years of the eighteenth century carry
our interest to North India and are notable as the beginning
of the organized missionary effort of the English
people for the redemption of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The Anglo-Saxons seem to have been the last
among Christian peoples to awake from the lethargy
of a self-centred, self-seeking Christianity, and to
enter upon the great missionary campaign for the
conquest of the world for Christ. It is true that the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel received
its first charter in 1701. But for more than a century
of its history it did not concern itself about carrying
the Gospel to the heathen races. It seems strange
that, up to that time, both the Protestant clergy and
laymen of Great Britain and America felt little or none
of that sense of obligation for the conversion of the
non-Christian world to Christ which has now become
so universal a conviction and a passion among them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the work of rousing the English to this grand
world-wide enterprise William Carey acquired well-earned
distinction. Though of humble origin and
wanting in early training, his spiritual vision and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contagious enthusiasm made him a leader of power.
Thus, God chose a cobbler youth to lead the Christian
hosts of England out of the bondage of narrow religious
sympathies into a world-wide conquest of
souls for Christ. Carey's efforts in England were
unremitting, and the contagion of his burning altruism
spread everywhere notwithstanding much
opposition and contempt met from a certain class.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His early efforts at home were supplemented by a
missionary life in India so remarkable in its self-denying
devotion, so characterized by distinguished
ability and linguistic genius, and so notable in wisdom
and persistence under the greatest difficulties that his
name will ever stand preëminent in all the annals of
missionary effort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it was very sad that, while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian</span></em> England
was waking out of her lethargy to her spiritual opportunities
and duties in India, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">commercial</span></em> England
threw herself across the path and denied the right of
Christian service for the Christless people of that
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Carey found no welcome or even permission to
work in British India. He was compelled to flee
from the territory of the East India Company and to
find refuge and opportunity for missionary work
under the more enlightened and progressive rule of
the Danish in Serampore. It was from that place
that he directed his missionary effort in India and
found the long-sought opportunity to serve his
Master in that heathen land. It was there that, in
company with his worthy associates, Marshman and
Ward, he built up a Christian community and translated
and published the Word of God into many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
oriental tongues. The success and achievements of
Carey would be regarded as phenomenal in the case
of any missionary. But when it is remembered that
he was compelled to support himself and his mission,
in considerable part, through his income in
secular pursuits; when it is also known that his wife
was, for many years, a wreck, mentally, and therefore
a source of great care and anxiety to him, how
wonderful must have been his faith, his persistence,
his intellectual endowments and his love for the
people of India to have led him to accomplish so
much for the cause of Christ in that great land!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Carey's life and example wrought wonders in its
influence upon others of his countrymen. Among a
noble band of followers is found the devout and
pious enthusiast Henry Martyn who, during his too
brief career as a chaplain in India, found time to commend
his Master and His Faith to many in that land
of darkness and death. Martyn was a worthy example
of what a consecrated chaplain can do for the
Christian cause, beyond the strict performance of his
priestly functions—an example which was perhaps
never more needed in India than at present when so
wide a gulf is found between the ordinary chaplain
and the missionary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a result of this missionary revival there also
came into existence not a few hopeful, vigorous
missionary societies. First among them was the
London Missionary Society which entered, in 1795,
upon its grand career of world-wide endeavour.
After that, was organized (in 1799) the Church Missionary
Society. Both of these organizations, at the
opening of the new century, began to put forth their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
best energies for the salvation of India. Then a host
of other lesser, but equally determined, agencies followed
in their train and made India their special field
of activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to distinctively English societies there
were organized, also, separate Scotch, Irish and Welsh
movements for work in the land—each nation vying
with every other in the work of upbuilding there the
Kingdom of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the British societies the Church Missionary
Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel,
and the London Missionary Society have done
most extensive service and have been markedly
blessed with growing communities and effective
organizations for work among the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Each nationality also represents a separate type of
life and activity. The English missions, for instance,
are strong in their wise organization and effective administration.
The Scotch, on the other hand, have a
genius for thoroughness in everything, especially in
educational work. The names of the greatest missionary
educators of India are, almost without exception,
Scotch. They have dug deep foundations
and have aimed, by means of their splendid schools,
to excel in the work of directing the thought of, and
imparting a new philosophy to, the rising generation
of Indians. If their results have not been statistically
impressive, so far as converts are concerned, they
have had preëminence in the task of transforming
the thought and of leavening the institutions of the
land. For instance, Alexander Duff—the father of the
higher educational work of missions, a man mighty
in thought and kindled with a sublime faith and a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christian enthusiasm—did not number many converts
as the result of his college training of the young.
But every convert under him counted for something
in the Christian Church. It is said that, of the forty-eight
educated men who were won to Christ through
his mission in 1871, nine were ministers, ten were
catechists, seventeen were professors and high-grade
teachers, eight, government servants of the higher
grade, and four, assistant surgeons and doctors.
Similar to the work of Dr. Duff in Calcutta was the
work of Dr. Wilson in Bombay and is the effort of
Dr. Miller, at present, in Madras. Mission results
must be weighed as well as measured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a contrast to this thought-directing and leavening
work of the Scottish Churches may be placed the
work of the Salvation Army in India. This unique
organization invaded that great land nearly a quarter
of a century ago. Believing that existing missionary
organizations and methods of work were too dignified,
staid and inadequate for best results, the leaders
of this movement introduced its cyclone methods
and proposed to take India by storm. They began by
insisting upon all their European officers conforming
to native custom, in clothing and diet. Their appeal
was simple even if their work was narrow and noisy.
It was a call upon all to immediate repentance and to
a belief upon the Lord, Christ, for salvation. They
ignored the Sacraments of the Church and, for a while,
even emulated the Hindus by daubing their religious
emblems upon their foreheads.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But their appeal fell flat upon a people who had no
Christian heritage or training; and their genuine
forms of self-denial and methods of adaptation, instead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of producing popular admiration and attachment,
soon produced pity and even contempt. If
the officers were men of spiritual ardour and were
kindled with a passion for the salvation of India,
they were also, on the whole, untrained and uncultured.
They not only disobeyed their Lord in neglecting
the Sacraments, they did not and could not
understand the people and their religion. By ignoring
all sanitary rules many of them vainly sacrificed their
lives to the Cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering the money expended, the precious
lives sacrificed and the efforts exhausted during this
quarter of a century the results achieved by this
organization have been painfully, though not unexpectedly,
small. It clearly illustrates and emphasizes
the fact that India is not to be won for Christ by a
campaign of ignorance and noise, however largely it
may be enforced by altruistic fervour. And it should
not be forgotten that the army officers have not
scrupled to enter territory already occupied by Christian
missions, to cause unspeakable annoyance to
workers on the field, and to fill up more than half the
ranks of their <span class="tei tei-q">“soldiers”</span> with people who already
claimed allegiance to Christ in connection with well-established
missions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Australia has recently fallen into the ranks of
those who carry the Gospel to India. One Faith
Mission in Western India is almost entirely conducted
by men and women of that country. A Baptist
Mission also is maintained by them there. And not
a few of the strong members of British missions are
Australians; these, with their work, are supported
by the churches which sent them forth.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Protestant Europe has not been conspicuous
for its missionary effort. And yet India owes a large
debt to the Christians of the Netherlands, Germany,
Denmark and Sweden for their effort to present to
them the message of life. As we have seen, the
Dutch, upon their first conquest in the East, sought
to introduce their faith among the people. The first
Protestant missionaries who gave their life for India
were Danes. They were supported by the private
resources of their own king. In early times Danish
settlements in India were the refuge of Gospel messengers
to that land. They protected them against
the unchristian narrowness and persecution of the
East India Company. The Danish settlement of
Serampore gave the only opportunity to Carey and
his associates for a home and for missionary work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible was the first time translated into an
Indian vernacular (Tamil) by our Continental brethren,
and the first vernacular Christian books were
printed in Germany.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the present time they are giving themselves
more fully than ever before to the work of India's
redemption. There are eight Continental Missions
conducted there, some of which have achieved considerable
success. The Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran
Mission has fallen heir to the first Danish mission
established at Tranquebar. It has at present a strong
force of workers, and they are scattered through
several Districts in South India, are doing solid and
substantial work and have gathered a numerous
Christian community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the most successful of these European
missions is the Basil German Evangelical Mission,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which is established upon the southwestern coast.
It is well organized, has a thorough educational system
and is embued with a strong evangelistic spirit.
Connected with this mission is an extensive and
prosperous Industrial Mission. With the German
spirit of thoroughness they have developed, more
largely than any other mission in India, the industrial
department, until it is now well established and fully
self-supporting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these European missions are systematic and
painstaking in the work which they are carrying forward.
In some respects this gives them well-earned
distinction. But, on the other hand, they labour
under a serious disability in having to acquire the
English as well as the vernacular of the people after
arriving in the land. They are also extremely conservative,
not to say antiquated, in their methods;
and they have not, in most cases, learned to hate and
antagonize, as they should, the terrible caste system
of the country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) The American participation in the Christian conquest
of India began early. It was the perusal of the
Life of David Brainerd, the American missionary
saint, which kindled the missionary zeal of William
Carey in England. On the other hand, the Life of
Carey had no small influence, at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, in giving irresistible impulse and
definiteness of purpose to that noble band of American
missionary pioneers—Mills and Nott, Newell and
Judson. And their consecrated enthusiasm and purpose
to labour for the conversion of the heathen nations,
in its turn, led, in 1810, to the founding of the
first foreign missionary society in the United States—the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first field chosen by this society for its activity
was India. It represented to them both the greatest
need and the best opportunity for Christian work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the first organized attempt of the Christian
Church of America to reach and to redeem the
heathen world was directed towards the land of the
Vedas. And the first band of missionaries which
that, now venerable, Board sent forth into the harvest
went, with eager anticipation and earnest prayer, to
that ancient and benighted people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how great must have been their disappointment
and sorrow, upon their arrival, to be refused
permission by the Honourable East India Company to
land in Calcutta. With sad hearts they turned their
faces towards Bombay, hoping that God would open
the way to their entering upon missionary service
there. This again was denied them and they fled to
Cochin, but were seized and brought back to Bombay
to await the arrival of an American ship to convey
them home. It was just then that their prayer was
answered and the Lord of Hosts came to their succour
and opened wide the door of that land to the missionary
labourer. A new charter was granted by the
British Parliament to the East India Company. In
that, insistence was made that the Christian missionary
be permitted to prosecute his work for the
heathen of that land unmolested. This charter
was granted in 1813, while the Americans were still
held in durance in Bombay.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the Magna Charta of missions for India; and
from that time until this the Christian missionary has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
found permission to preach his message in that land.
He has also enjoyed there ample protection in the exercise
of all his religious duties and work as a messenger
of Christ. By this charter missions received
State sanction to obey heaven's command, and missionaries
of all lands came to enjoy, on British territory
in the East, the undisputed right to carry the
gospel of our Lord to heathen people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The impatient little band of missionaries were
therefore released at Bombay; and from that day
until this America has found joy in her effort to
convey her spiritual blessings to that land. Adoniram
Judson, having become a Baptist, was directed
by Carey to Burma where he laboured for many years
with apostolic zeal and with distinguished success.
The nearly 150,000 native Christians of Burma today
owe their conversion largely to Judson's wise initiative,
resistless energy, grand Christian faith and
inspiring example.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mills, who was the leader in the early band of
students whose zeal led to the organization of the
American Board, found his field of service on the
West coast of Africa, whence also he was early
called to his heavenly reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The saintly Harriet Newell, wife of another member
of this distinguished company, died on the Isle
of France, and her sorrowing husband returned to
Bombay and rejoined his brethren Hall and Nott.
These three, therefore, were the founders of this first
American Mission in India—now called the American
Mahratta Mission. Bombay, Ahmednaggar and
Sholapur are its principal centres of work; and it
covers a field whose population is between three and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
four millions. It has had distinguished success and
has gathered the largest native community among
the Protestant missions of Western India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1834 the same society established its South India
Mission at Madura. This was an offshoot from the
Jaffna Mission which was founded in 1815 in that
northern corner of Ceylon. The Madura Mission has
prospered, has 18,000 in its Christian community,
and is regarded as one of the best organized missions
in the country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1834 the American Presbyterians, while yet connected
with the American Board, established in the
Northwest their large and successful mission. Its
centres of work are Lahore, Lodiana, Futtegarh,
Dera-Dun and Allahabad. This mission has done
excellent work and has attained high eminence among
the missions of North India, both for its educational
work, its leavening influence and for its evangelistic
zeal. A number of its missionaries suffered martyrdom
during the terrible Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. It
was from that mission that the first call to universal
prayer for the conversion of the world was sent
forth. And thus was founded the Week of Prayer
which now finds such general observance among
Protestant Christians.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1836 the Baptists established for Telugu people,
on the southeastern coast, the famous <span class="tei tei-q">“Lone Star
Mission.”</span> It has had such phenomenal success that,
though established only in 1840 in a purely heathen
field, and notwithstanding the fact that the first
twenty-five years of its efforts were barren of outward
results, it is to-day by far the largest mission
in India, having 53,790 communicants and a community
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of 200,000. Its chief centres of work are
Ongole and Nellore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Rev. Samuel Day was sent out by the society
in 1835 to Chicacole, but in 1837 removed to Madras.
After three years' labour there he resolved to establish
a mission among the Telugu people, and so removed
to Nellore and commenced work there in March,
1840. The unproductiveness of the work in the early
history was such that the abandonment of the mission
was several times under consideration. But in
1866 prosperity dawned. Later followed the great
accessions which have, up to the present, continued
in greater or less degree and which have been on a
larger scale than in any other field in South India.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The history of Christianity, in all ages and countries,
shows nothing which surpasses the later years
of this mission in spontaneous extension, in rapidity
of progress, in genuineness of conversions, in stability
of results or in promise for the future.”</span> The
church organized with eight members by Dr. Clough
at Ongole in 1867 numbers now its thousands. The
great famine of 1877 presented a large Christian opportunity
which was eagerly seized by Dr. Clough,
himself a civil engineer, in the conduct of large
famine relief works under government and in the
Christian instruction of many thousands who laboured
under him. This itself created a wonderful movement
which has been marvellously used of God in the
conversion of the people. Nearly all of these converts
have come from the lowest class of society.
But at present the higher classes are beginning to
consider the claims of the Gospel. It is natural that
the most serious problem and principal concern of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this mission has been to keep pace with the movement,
and to train suitable agents for the guidance
and instruction of the incoming thousands. It has
also been largely blessed in this line, as its various
and growing institutions testify.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the Madura Mission was the daughter of the
Jaffna Mission so the Madras section of the Madura
Mission, in the year 1851, became the mother of a
vigorous daughter. For the members of the Scudder
family—a family famed in missionary annals—were
appointed to the District of Arcot, some seventy
miles south of Madras, and there began a work under
the American Dutch Reformed Church which has
rapidly grown into power and promise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 1856 the Methodists of America entered
upon their great work in that land. With their
wonted zeal and evangelistic fervour they carried forward
a vigorous campaign in North India. They
early found an opening among the outcaste people
as the Baptists had found among the same in the
South; and they eagerly entered the open door and
vigorously prosecuted their endeavours for that
class. Their success has been signal. More than
100,000 people have been gathered into their Christian
community and an equal number of others are
desirous to place themselves under their spiritual care
and guidance. They have also entered seriously into
the work of training an agency and of educating the
densely ignorant members of their community. In
addition to their village schools they have a large
theological and normal school, besides two colleges,
one of which is perhaps the best college for women
in Northern India, if not in the East. Their work
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has now spread to many parts of the land and even
to Burma and the Straits settlement. They have also
wisely cultivated the press and the publishing department
as an important auxiliary in their work.
In this department they are perhaps doing more than
any other society now at work in India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great success of this society in India is largely
owing to the wise leadership of that missionary
statesman—Bishop Thoburn. I doubt whether many
other missionaries, if indeed any other, have wrought
more for the redemption of that people than this
sturdy American of ample common—and uncommon—sense,
of wide vision, of sublime faith and of masterful
generalship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several divisions of the American Lutheran community
have also wrought much for India and are
justly proud of their prosperous missions, especially
in South India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In like manner American <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith Missions,”</span> not a
few, have planted the banner of the cross in that
land of the trident and are prosecuting their mission
and proclaiming their message with singleness of
purpose and exemplary zeal. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian Alliance”</span>
is the most pretentious organization of this
class which does work in that land. Its efforts are
chiefly confined to the Bombay Presidency where it
has a goodly number of earnest workers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Organizations for the young—the Y. M. C. A., Y.
W. C. A., Y. P. S. C. E., S. V. M.,—while they are
not in any sense distinctly American, are nevertheless
dominated by the American spirit and methods, and
are, to a large extent under the guidance of American
youth. These Christian movements are doing royal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
service for the Kingdom of Christ in that stronghold
of error. They bring cheer to the missionaries,
youthful inspiration to the churches, a wide opportunity
to the young life of the Christian communities
and a new pace to all the messengers of Christ in the
land. The Y. M. C. A. is also doing an excellent
evangelistic work among the educated non-Christian
youth of India—a work that is appealing mightily to
their deepest spiritual instincts and is impressing them,
as nothing else does, with the combined sanity and
spirituality, the reasonableness and the saving power
of our faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must also allude to that unique American Institution—the
Haskell-Barrows lectureship—which has
already done no small good to the educated of the
land, and has within itself the possibility of largest
blessing to the country. It was founded in connection
with the University of Chicago; and it appoints
and sends to India once every two or three years a
distinguished lecturer to present the excellence of our
faith in its philosophy and life in such a manner
as shall best commend it and appeal to the thoughtful
non-Christians of the Orient. Every effort of
this kind which shall emphasize to Hindus the harmony
of Christian truth and the best thinking of our
age and shall reveal to them Christ as the Redeemer
and Exemplar of our race and as the only <span class="tei tei-q">“Name
under heaven given among men whereby we must
be saved,”</span> is to be cordially welcomed among God's
best forces for India's redemption. And America is
to be congratulated because she is the first to endow
and to inaugurate such a helpful agency for the glory
of God and the salvation of India's men of culture.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is comforting to the American worker in
India to be assured that the modern rulers of the land
are amply atoning for the unchristian and rude incivility
of their predecessors in office ninety years
ago. For they not only cordially welcome the
Christian worker from the States; they also reveal
full appreciation of his labours, render him every protection
and are not averse to praising him for his arduous
endeavours. Listen to the words of Lord Wenlock,
while Governor of Madras,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Our cousins in
America,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“are not, as we are, responsible
for the welfare of a very large number of the human
race; but seeing our difficulties and knowing how
much there is to do, they have not hesitated to put
their hands into their pockets to assist us in doing
that which is almost impossible for any government
to achieve unassisted. They go out themselves, their
wives and their sisters; they enter into all parts of
the country, they send a very large amount of money
and they spend their time and their health in promoting
the welfare of those who are in no way
connected with them.... In all Districts I
find our American cousins joining with us in improving
the system of education and in extending it
wherever it was wanted. To their efforts we owe
a very great deal. It must be recognized that their
great object is the advancement of the Christian religion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lord Harris, the Governor, of Bombay, a little more
than a decade ago, also said publicly, of the work of
the American Board Mission among the Maharattas,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I
do not think I can too prominently say
that our gratitude towards this American Mission has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been piling up and piling up all the years of this
century.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Our record of the efforts of Christian countries
in behalf of India were not complete without a
reference to the hearty coöperation of Protestant
Canada in this work. Several missions have been
established there by Canadian Baptists and Presbyterians;
and these are flourishing and are adding
daily to the number of those who are being saved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking at the whole force of Protestant Christian
missions in that land today we are impressed with
the magnitude of its organization, work and success.
Nearly two and a half million dollars are devoted annually
by the Christians of the West to this work of
saving this great one of the East. It is a great financial
investment, but not to be compared with that of
the thousands of choice men and women who go
forth and give themselves unto death that they might
enable Christ to see of the travail of His soul and be
satisfied among the millions of that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Comparing present missionary agency and methods
in India with those of past ages it may be well
to consider the differences and gather therefrom assurance
for the coming of the Kingdom of our Lord
in the East. These differences are numerous and
radical. I need only refer to a few of them:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The spell of an ecclesiastical, and the glamour
of a ceremonial, Christianity is being increasingly
substituted by the moral and spiritual characteristics
of our faith in that land. The conversion of India is
less and less regarded by Christian workers in the
land as a change from the ceremonial and ritual of
the old, to those of the new, faith. Ever increasing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emphasis is given to the fact that to be a Christian is
to live the Christ-life and to be loyal to Him in all the
ethical and spiritual teachings of the Sermon on the
Mount. And these missionary workers care less to
touch the life of our converts on the surface and
more to grip it at its centre and to transform character.
And this is a work which is most enduring in
its results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Christian workers in India are learning mutual
sympathy and appreciation in their work. Instead
of the old jealousies, suspicions, antipathies and misunderstandings
of the past, there is found a developing
sense of oneness, of fellowship, of comity, amity
and mutual helpfulness among the missionaries of
that land. The watchword of to-day is coöperation.
The distracting spectacle of a divided Christianity, of
hated and mutually hating Christian sects in a heathen
land is surely passing away and the dawning of the
day of peace and harmony and fellowship in Christian
work is upon us. And India will enjoy the
wonderful results of this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) The serious mistakes of method and standpoint
in missions of former centuries are now
avoided. The compromise which they made with
Hinduism in caste and in other matters is no longer
possible in Protestant missions. We know, as they
could not, the irreconcilable antagonism of caste to
Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand we know Hinduism and other
non-Christian faiths better than our fathers did. We
are not so anxious to trace all these back to Satanic
origin. We are learning the sympathies as well as
the antipathies of religions. The translators of God's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Word into the vernacular of India two centuries and
one century ago largely avoided the use of popular
terms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because</span></em> they were popular and the common-vehicles
of Hindu thought, which (they said) was of
the devil. We see the folly of such an avoidance
and the need of using and rehabilitating the religious
terminology of the people that we may the more
surely come into touch with them, and the more
easily convey to them the deepest truths of our faith.
Formerly, missionaries declined to use the music of
Hinduism because it enriched the temple services and
<span class="tei tei-q">“was of the devil.”</span> Today these same sweet and
plaintive songs are wedded to beautiful Christian
hymns, prepared by native Christian poets, and are
the appropriate and very popular vehicles of the best
Christian thought and sentiment to Christian and
non-Christian natives alike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This only illustrates the fact that the Christian message
and work are finding greater power over the
people because conveyed to them in more intelligible
terms. It can come home to them in their common
life as it did not formerly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Educational work is increasingly utilized. Formerly
missionary effort was mostly the work of the
preacher—it was the direct Gospel message and appeal.
To this has been added the no less necessary,
indeed the deeper, work of transforming the thought
of the land and of introducing everywhere a Christian
philosophy and a process of thinking which will
undermine the old methods and foundations of Hinduism.
This Christian education, which is now
being imparted in India to nearly half a million youth
in our schools, is a leavening power the extent of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whose influence no one can compute. And it carries
within itself untold possibilities for the conversion of
India. By these institutions, Sir William Muir truly
tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“the country has been inoculated with
Christian sentiment.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sir Charles U. Atchison declares that, in his judgment,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the value of educational missionary institutions,
in the present transition state of Indian opinion,
can hardly be overrated. It is more than ever the
duty of the Church to go forward in its educational
policy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In other ways also, medical and industrial, Christian
work has broadened out so that it reaches the
people at all points and lifts up the Christian community
into a self-respecting power which will abide
and grow in influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In modern missions the Word of God, translated
into all the vernaculars of the people, has become the
mightiest instrument of progress in Christian life, and
the most ubiquitous messenger of Christian truth.
The Bible was almost a sealed book to the people of
India when William Carey arrived at the close of the
eighteenth century. The Roman Catholic and Syrian
Christians had done nothing to bring this blessing to
the people. The Danish mission, as we have seen,
had translated it into the Tamil tongue. And that
was all. How wonderful the work of the last century
whereby this blessed Word has been translated
into every language and many dialects of polyglot
India. Among its 300,000,000 inhabitants there are
few who cannot find God's own Word translated
into their own speech, published and brought to their
doors. Can any one realize how great a leverage this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is in the work of overturning that land religiously
and in bringing Christ into the life of India?
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the history of Christian effort in India has
not been without its many lessons. And these lessons
have brought wisdom and, with that wisdom,
confidence and growing efficiency to the Christian
forces now at work in the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For this reason the progress of the Kingdom of
Christ in India will, during the present century, be
much more marked and its triumphs more signal than
in the past centuries. And for this well-founded
assurance we thank God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The present missionary force in India represents,
according to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Indian Missionary
Directory,”</span> a body of nearly 2,500 men and
women who have been sent from Europe, America
and Australia to instruct the people in the blessings
of our faith. This body is constantly increasing in
numbers and is sent forth and maintained by some
seventy societies.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> They are a noble band of Christian
workers, of no less consecration and faith than
those in the past, and of the highest training and
broadest culture ever known.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary furnishes to the home churches the
chief interest in missionary work and is the link
which connects them and the home society with their
enterprise abroad.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His work at present is not what it once was in
India. In earlier days the missionary had to be a
man of all works; every form of missionary endeavour
came under his direction. In mission work,
as in every other line of effort, specialization has become
a feature and a necessity. There must be men
of as varied talents and special lines of training as
there are departments of missionary work. But
every missionary should be preëminently, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a man</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He should be a man of large calibre. There is much
danger lest the church become indifferent to this matter,
and send to the mission field inferior men—men
who would be unable to stem the tide of competition
and attain success at home. If a man is not
qualified for success in the home land, there is little
chance of his attaining much usefulness upon the
mission field. And an inferior class of men sent out
to heathen lands to represent, and to conduct the
work of, the home church must necessarily react
upon the church through want of success, discouragement
and defeat in the missionary enterprise. A
church whose missionary representatives abroad are
wanting in fitness and power cannot long continue
to be a strenuous missionary church; it will lack fuel
to keep burning the fire of missionary enthusiasm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in speaking of the missionary I include the
lady missionary. Missionary ladies today are more
numerous in India than are the men. More than
a thousand single ladies have given themselves to the
missionary life and are labouring with conspicuous
success in that land. They meet almost the same
conditions of life and require the same qualifications
for success as their brother missionaries do. Of
course, in certain details, they differ; but into such
matters I cannot enter at present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I desire to enumerate the qualifications of a missionary
for highest usefulness in India at the present
time.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 4.00em; margin-top: 4.00em">

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">1. Physical Fitness.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is a man physically qualified to be sent out into
missionary work? For an enterprise like this, where
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a man practically enlists for life, it is of much concern
to the Society which appoints him, and of great
importance to the work which he is to take up that
he be possessed of good health. This is preëminently
true in the case of all those who are appointed
to India. The climate of India is trying, though it is
neither dangerous nor as fruitful in difficulty, as
many believe. It is not necessary that a man who is
sent out to India be possessed of robust health. Indeed,
I have often noticed that the most robust are
the most likely to yield, through ill-health, to climatic
influences there. This is chiefly owing to the fact
that such people are usually careless in all things pertaining
to health. They place too much reliance upon
their stock of vigour, and ignore, until too late, the insidious
influences of the tropical sun. We ask not
for a man of great bodily vigour; but he should be
possessed of organic soundness. Such a man may
stand the climate longer and work with fewer interruptions
than his more vigorous brother; simply because
he knows that his health is delicate and appreciates
the necessity of taking suitable care of himself.
On the whole, my experience has led me to
two convictions about this matter; the first is that
the less robust and more careful missionaries stand
well that tropical climate; and in the second place,
that to those who do take adequate care of themselves,
the climate of India is neither dangerous nor
insanitary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, however, certain precautions which missionaries
should take in that land in order to insure
the proper degree of efficient service. Annual periods
of rest at hill <span class="tei tei-q">“sanitaria”</span> are not only desirable,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but are necessary, in order to preserve the health and
add to one's usefulness. Many of the best missions
in India, at present, not only arrange that their missionaries
take this rest, but demand it of them. They
have learned by experience that it is a reckless waste
of precious power for their missionaries to continue
working upon the hot plains until compelled by a
break-down to seek rest and restoration. It is much
easier, in the tropics, to preserve, than to restore,
health. Many a noble service has been cut short,
and many a useful career has been spoiled by recklessly
continuing work for a few years without rest
or change in that land. The youngest and the least
organized missions, and consequently those which
have not perfected arrangements for the rest and
health of their members, are those which have the
largest number of break-downs, and which lose most
in labour and money on account of the ill health of
their missionaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Visits to the home land every eight or ten years are
also desirable, not only for restoration of physical
vigour, but also, for a recementing of domestic and
social ties and for a renewed contact with and a new
inspiration from the Church of God in the West.
Life in all its aspects has a tendency to degenerate in
the tropics; and one needs occasional returns to
northern climes for the blessings which they alone
can give.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shall the missionary indulge in recreations? Among
missionaries themselves this is a much debated question.
Some maintain that all forms of recreation are
unworthy of a man engaged in this holy calling. I
do not agree with them. I have seen many missionaries
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
helped in their work by such recreation. There
are some men and women who have no taste for such
diversions. To them they may have little value or
usefulness. But, to the ordinary missionary who has
done a hard day's work an hour's diversion in tennis,
badminton or golf has often been a godsend. It has
brought relief to the tense nerves and a new lease of
life to the organs of the body. In a similar way an interest
in carpentry, in geology, photography, or any
other set study, brings to the jaded mind a diversion
and a new lease of power, and prepares one to go back
to his work with fresh pleasure and renewed enthusiasm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One should carefully avoid entering inordinately
into any such recreation. There is danger, and
sometimes a serious danger, that such lines of diversion
may be carried to an excess, and the mind and
heart be thereby robbed of, rather than strengthened
for, one's life-work.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are questions of importance which come
under this consideration and which are much discussed
at the present time. It is asked, for instance,
whether a man should go out as a married, or as a
single, missionary. A few years ago the American
Board showed very decided preference for the married
missionary, and hesitated to send, except under
special circumstances, bachelors. Missionary societies
connected with ritualistic churches, on the other
hand, have given preference, almost exclusive preference,
to the unmarried missionary. At the present
time there is a growing feeling, in all Protestant denominations,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that there is a demand, and a specially
appropriate field of usefulness, both for the married
and the unmarried missionary. The supreme argument
in favour of the married man is connected with
the home influence which he establishes and which,
in itself, is a great blessing to the heathen people
among whom he lives. The light and beauty of a
Western Christian home is always a mighty testimony,
not only to the Gospel, but to the civilization
of the West which is a direct product of the Gospel.
Through the wife is also conserved the health of the
husband who is thereby rendered more efficient.
And to his activity is added her equally beneficent
one among the women of their charge. The missionary
home constitutes a testimony and a power
which no mission can be without.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, there is a large and an attractive
field of usefulness which can best be worked by the
unmarried man and woman. There are forms of activity
and lines of self-denial which can best be met
by those who are not tied down by home life and
who are more free to meet the rapidly changing
necessities of certain departments of work. It is
also true that the unmarried life represents to the
Orient that type of self-denial which has always been
associated, in their mind, with the highest degree of
religious attainment; and it may, for this very reason,
be in the line of highest influence upon the people of
the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So, married and unmarried life have in the mission
field today their recognized place, advantage, and
sphere of influence. And, working together they
will exemplify to the people those forms of religious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
life and activity which bring highest glory to our
cause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another question pertains to the missionary's daily
life. Shall he conform to the ordinary habits of life
practiced by the people among whom he lives? In
other words, shall the missionary from the West conform
to native customs in food and dress? It is not
possible to give a categorical reply to this question.
A country should be studied and the ideals of the
people thoroughly investigated by the missionary before
he decides upon any course of action in this
matter. There are countries where such conformity
would be desirable and would add considerably to
the missionary's influence and success. China is
such a country; and many of the missionaries in that
land find it to their interest, and to the interest of the
work, to adopt the Chinese costume, cue and all.
They thus cease to appear foreign and peculiar in a
land where to be a foreigner is to be hated, or at
least to be unloved and distrusted by the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same thing has been tried in India, not only in
clothing, but also to a large extent in food. Many a
missionary, feeling how great a barrier his foreign
habits created between him and the people, and
inspired by a passionate desire to come near to them
in order that he might bless them, has divested himself
of European clothing, adopted the native costume
(at least so far as it was possible for him to do so)
and has confined himself to native food. But I have
never known of any Western missionary who has
continued this method for a long time and declared it
a success. One of the most pathetic instances on
record is that of the famous Jesuit missionary Abbe
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Du Bois, who, after a careful study of the situation,
donned the yellow garb of the Hindu monk and
became practically a Hindu to the Hindus, spending
most of his time in travelling from town to town and
living strictly, both as regards food, clothing, and
general habits, as an ordinary Hindu in order that he
might gain close access to the people and thus win
many converts to the Roman Catholic Church. For
many years, in a distinguished missionary career, he
followed this method of life. But was it a success?
In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Life and Letters,”</span> written at the close of his
missionary life, he frankly confesses that that method
of approach to the people had proved an entire
failure; that he had not thereby gained any added
influence over them or had become better able to lead
them into the Christian fold. He maintains that, so
far as this style of living was concerned, he had
accomplished absolutely nothing for India. I have
known of ardent and able Protestant missionaries
also who have tried the same method, with the same
result, and have returned to their Western costume
and food.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Salvation Army, at the beginning of its work
a few years ago in India, compelled all its officers
fully to adopt Indian methods of life. This was
enforced, in its rigour, only for a short time; but for
a sufficiently long period to reveal its disastrous effects
upon the health and life of its European officers.
Their system has been considerably modified, but is
still unsatisfactory on the score of health and usefulness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is now recognized by all that the differences
between the natives of tropical India and the inhabitants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of northern climes, and between the tropical
clime and that of the temperate zone, are so great that
we of the Northwest cannot, with wisdom and impunity,
adopt the manners of life of that people.
There are differences so great, both in clothing and
in food, that it would require generations of acclimatization
before the change could be wisely adopted
in its entirety. It is indeed desirable that the European
or American, who goes to live in the tropics,
should change somewhat his diet so as to meet the
changed requirements of his system there. But, to
adopt the native diet is a very different thing, and
will be conducive neither to nourishment nor digestion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, however, another question of more importance
than this and one which seriously confronted
the Abbe Du Bois. What is gained in accessibility
to, and power over, the people by adopting these
native habits? It should be remembered that Westerners
have lived in India so long as to have become
perfectly well known to all the people. Moreover,
the Western garb and habits of life represent to the
Hindu honour, influence, power, and culture. In his
heart of hearts the Hindu highly respects, and is
always ready to listen to, that man of the West who
is true to himself and stands before him for what he
is and for what he teaches. The ordinary Hindu is
not stupid enough to be deceived as to a man's
nationality or true position in life because of his
change of clothing or food. Indeed, to nine-tenths
of all Hindus, such a change of habits, on the part of
a European, would mean nothing else than that he
had lost caste among his own people and had descended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to a much lower social scale than formerly.
It is well to remember in India that the way of access
to the people is opened to the Westerner not through
such outer changes of life, but through true manifestations
of kindness and love to them. They are
quick to understand the language of love and would
never confound it with outer posings of men who are
thereby seeking to win their favour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Rev. Geo. Bowen, of Bombay, was perhaps one
of the most self-denying of all the missionaries who
lived in that land. He reduced the annual expenses
of his living to $150.00. It was in this path of self-denial
that he sought to find greatest usefulness as a
missionary. Of this life he said at one time: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have not been wholly disappointed, but I have not
been successful enough to make me feel like advising
any one else to follow my example. And yet I have
not so completely failed as to make me regret the
course which I have pursued. I have discovered that
the gulf which separates the people of this country is
not a social one at all; it is simply the great impassable
gulf which separates between the religion of
Christ and an unbelieving world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be laid down as a general principle of life in
that land that the missionary should adopt that
method of life which, while consistent with severe
economy, shall best conduce to health and efficiency
of service among the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in this connection it should also be stated that
there are many things which are perfectly natural and
wise and desirable in the line of self help in America
which should be unnecessary and unwise in such a
land as India. It is a safe rule adopted by the best
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
missionary workers in that land that a European
should never do those things which can easily be
done by natives in the matter of domestic service.
It would be folly for a missionary man or woman to
spend much time in household work and in similar
duties when there are many people around whose
special province that is, and who can do it for one-thirtieth
his own wage, and who can thus release him
for the more serious and higher duties of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, in all these matters, one should consider fully
the whole situation—the character of the climate, of
the people, and the conditions of the best health and
efficiency and greatest usefulness of the missionary
worker.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question as to the length of the missionary's
service is an important one. Shall he enter upon it
for a definite term or shall he consider it his life
work? In most missions and societies the missionary
service is considered a life service. It is a service so
peculiar in its training and in its direction; it tends in
many ways so to lead a man away from the atmosphere
of work and direction of activity found at
home, that it is better for him, who undertakes it at
all, to consecrate himself to it as the great mission of
his life. It is also a fact that the longer he continues
in it, the more ability and aptness he acquires for
that special work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, of course, some who will find that they
have mistaken their vocation and that missionary
work does not suit them; or, rather, that they are
not adapted to it. Such people should make no delay
in returning home and in seeking a more congenial
life work.

of the Missionary.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever may have been the case in the past, the
day certainly has come when India demands only
men and women of wide intelligence and thorough
training as missionaries. Whether we regard it as a
land of profound philosophy, and of a marvellously
organized religion; or whether we consider the intellectual
power of many of the natives of that land,
the missionary must be amply prepared, through
educational and intellectual equipment, to meet them.
One of the saddest sights seen in India is a missionary
who has absolutely no interest in the religious philosophy
of the land, and who is not able to appreciate
the mutual relations of that faith and his own and
who is unequal to the task of discussing intelligently
with, and of convincing in, matters of faith, the
educated natives of the country. Such a man apparently
did not know that he would meet in that
land many university graduates who are still believers
in, and defenders of, their ancestral faith. So he
finds himself unable to stand before such men and
to give reason for the faith that is in him so as to
satisfy their earnest, intelligent inquiries, or to quiet
their keen opposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should also be remembered that, in addition to
this growing host of natives of university training
and culture, there is a considerable number of Europeans
in government service and in other departments.
They come into constant touch with the
missionary, and gauge his culture and capacity, and
are sure to judge of the missionary work according
to their estimate of his training and qualification.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In such a land, and facing such conditions, and in
the presence of such people, the missionary should
be a man of thorough training and culture, and
should have a mind which has ample command of
the treasures of knowledge which it has acquired.
He should also be able to find interest in various
branches of learning. As I said above, he should, in
some respects, be a man of special training with
definite and high qualifications for the special department
upon which he has entered; but he should also
be not narrow, but of broad sympathies and of a
growing interest in the general realm of culture. He
should continue to cultivate his student tastes, and
should grow constantly in ability and aptitude to
grapple with the mighty problems of the land. He
should be able not only to understand the many
aspects of Hinduism and of Buddhism, which has
entered so largely into the Hindu faith, but he must
also know considerable about Mohammedanism, since
it is held by one-fifth of the population of that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is well that he be thoroughly grounded in Christian
doctrine before he enters upon his missionary
duties. I have known men to enter the mission field
who had not clear views and definite convictions
concerning some of the most essential Christian doctrines;
with the consequence that they drifted away
from their moorings and had to recast their faith,
under adverse circumstances, on the field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mission field is no place for a man to readjust
his faith and to discover that his religious affiliations
are not what they ought to be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not a question whether a man's theology is of
the conservative, or of the progressive, type. Both
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
types may be needed. It is largely a question
whether he has grasped clearly and with conviction
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> doctrine—whether he has thought for himself
and appropriated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> system of truth. Or, I should
say, whether any sort of theology has gripped him
in its power. Bishop Thoburn has well said that
<span class="tei tei-q">“the young missionary should have a clear and well-grounded
theology before going abroad. His views
of vital theological truth should be clear and settled.
The Christian Church of America cannot afford to
export doubts or even religious speculation to foreign
fields. The people of India, and I may add of other
lands, are abundantly able to provide all the doubts
and all the unprofitable speculation that any church
will care to contend with; and one important qualification
of the missionary should be a positive faith
as opposed to doubt, and a clear system of living
truth as opposed to profitless speculation.”</span> Above
all, the missionary should have a working faith in the
gospel—not a half-grounded conviction. There may
be a place <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at home</span></em> for the unsettled mind; the mission
field is not for such. In India, especially, while
there is ample room and abundant opportunity and
inducement for progress in thought and development
in doctrinal construction, there is no place for destructive
doubts and mental unsettlement. Positive
teaching and not interrogations and destructive doubts
should characterize the missionary. Give us a man
who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em> something and is inspired with convictions.
For, it should be remembered, the missionary
is preëminently an instructor. He must give himself
to the work of establishing others in living, satisfying,
saving truth. He is to instruct the people, as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preacher, in the way of salvation. He is also called
upon to furnish a working equipment of truth to
pastors, preachers and teachers. He should be conversant
with the Bible and with the various theories
of interpretation. He should be possessed of a clear
system of theology and should understand the best
methods and principles of Christian work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the attaining of all this, the missionary must
continue as an earnest student, he must maintain
upon the field thorough habits of study. His missionary
life, itself, should be to him, not only an interpreter
of what he formerly studied, but an incitement
to further regular study. Many temptations
overtake the missionary to intellectual indolence as
well as to intellectual dissipation. He is in danger,
under the pressure of other interesting work and distractions,
either not to read anything very seriously
or to read in a haphazard, desultory way. The latter
is specially a dangerous habit on the mission field.
The missionary needs not only to cultivate habits of
study and to devote certain hours daily, so far as possible,
to that habit; he should, preëminently, keep
before him some definite aim or ideal towards which
all his reading should be directed. If he be specially
a preacher, he should conscientiously and thoroughly
prepare his sermons as if he were to preach to the
most cultured audiences; or, if he instruct his agents,
he should make previous, elaborate preparation for
the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He should take an intelligent interest in, and make
a thorough study of, the people, their social and religious
customs, their economic conditions, their educational
efforts, their history,—these and many other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
studies will furnish abundant and abounding interest
to the thoughtful missionary and will add to his
power in his work. In all these respects, no people
on earth are more interesting than those of India.
And for successful spiritual work among them the
missionary needs to study these side issues more than
he would, perhaps, among any other people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He will find it of much help if he is apt at acquiring
language. A good and usable knowledge of the vernacular
of the people is a most important avenue of
access to their mind and heart. The acquiring of a
living language is a very different thing from the
study of a dead language. A man may be a success
in the one and a failure in the other. A good ear is
of paramount importance in a first-class facility for
acquiring and using a modern vernacular.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would not say that a man who has not a good
command of the vernacular of a people cannot be to
them a good missionary; for a few of the best missionaries
I know, speak the vernacular wretchedly.
But I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> emphasize the fact that proficiency here is of
prime importance and I would also add that it should
be the first work of a missionary after entering his
field. To dawdle with the language the first year, is,
generally speaking, to fail in acquiring it at all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Should a young man, who intends to become a
missionary, receive a special preparatory training for
missionary work? Yes, to a certain extent. I heartily
approve of all recent courses established in theological
institutions with a view to training their students in
missionary principles and literature. And I would
that these courses were much enlarged so as to correspond
with the relative importance of the missionary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work. Beyond all this, I believe that every student,
who intends to become a missionary, should
spend time during his last year or two as a student in
special preparation for his work and field. For instance,
it were a great help to him who is to become
a missionary in India that he study seriously the
Sanskrit language and Hindu philosophy. These two
would give him an important start upon his missionary
career and, probably, furnish him with initial
taste for that larger equipment which is essential to
the great missionary. It is of course understood that
the modern science of Comparative Religion has already
had his attention in the general course of study.
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the study
of this science as an aid to the modern missionary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would also urge here the importance of each missionary,
so far as his tastes and ability permit, preparing
himself for the work of enriching the Christian
literature of the field and country of his choice. In
India this is becoming a matter, not only of growing,
but also of paramount, importance. In the past, missionaries
have been too much engrossed with the
other departments of work to give themselves to the
production of tracts and books. Much more must be
done in this line in the future. Every year adds to
the need for, and the influence of, a worthy literary
effort expressed in the various vernaculars of India.
The growing host of readers in the Christian communities
and among the non-Christians is a loud cry
for missionary consecration to this specific work.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would hardly seem necessary to speak on this
subject. It must be everywhere understood that a
life of spiritual power is, and must ever remain, the
first requisite of the missionary. And yet, I fear that
the missionary force of today reveals more serious
delinquency at this point than at any other. If missionaries
were asked, wherein lies the chief hindrance
to their work, I believe they would, all but unanimously,
refer to their want of spiritual power. Not
that they are more defective in this respect than are
the ministers at home. They are a noble band of
consecrated men and women. But they greatly need,
and bemoan their need of, a growing spiritual endowment,
the possession of which would give to them a
new joy, and, to the people, an inexhaustible gift of
life, and to the missionary work a power hitherto unknown.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A man should not go out as a foreign missionary
unless he has a definite call from God to go. It must
be laid so strongly upon his heart that he feels the
necessity of going forth unto the heathen. There
must be a constraining power and a felt conviction
within, that in the mission field alone can he find rest
and peace and power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary should be a man of pronounced
and positive spirituality—a man who loves the Word
of God, who finds meditation in it sweet, and who
finds relief, strength and joy in frequent daily prayer.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The depressing influences which beset his spiritual
life are many. The all-pervasive, chilling influence
of heathenism, and its dead and deadening ceremonialism
tend to exercise an increasing power over
him. He will not, at first, realize this influence; but
as an insidious and an ever swelling tide of evil it
will come into his soul, unless he is well guarded and
daily fortified against it by frequent communion with
God. In India the hardening influence of the all-surrounding
heathenism is as subtle as it is potent in its
influence upon the life of any Christian worker and
needs to be overcome by constant spiritual culture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The life of the European Christians who reside in
that country is so far from being Christlike and is so
wanting in these spiritual traits which should characterize
an earnest Christian, that the missionary constantly
has to guard himself against its influence upon
himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The loneliness of the missionary—his frequent and
long-continued absence from those means of grace
which so largely minister to the spiritual strength of
a pastor in this country—is something deeply felt.
Few men realize the extent of the spiritual helps
which the Christian society of America renders to the
aspiring life of a man of God. In his loneliness, in the
far-off land, the missionary feels its absence keenly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover, all the native Christians of the community
of which he is the official head look up to
him for inspiration. Is he wanting in faith, hopefulness
and cheer; is he depressed and discouraged; is
he lacking in the power of prayer and of sweet communion
with God? It is marvellous how quickly
this frame of mind is transmitted from him to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
people of his charge. The pastors, catechists and
other mission agents of his field all look to him for
their ideal and seek to draw from him their inspiration
in spiritual life. Is he down; then they are down
with him. In coldness as in spiritual ardour they
faithfully reflect his life and temper. It is, indeed,
true that many of these live spiritual lives which bring
inspiration and spiritual joy to him. The simplicity
and earnestness of the faith of most of the native
Christians is beautiful. Still, in many respects, he
finds the community a heavy spiritual drain upon
him; and, if he is to maintain himself as a worthy
leader in the higher Christian life, he must live constantly
with God and find daily strength in Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India, specially, there are needed a few definite
spiritual gifts which I desire to emphasize and which
a missionary should aim to cultivate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first in order, if not in importance, is patience.
To us of the West the Orient seems preëminently
slow. To them of the East we of the West rush
everything unduly and are the victims of impatience.
There is much truth in that homely skit of
Kipling's:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ordinary Hindu will endure the white man's impatience,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and he and the native Christian will submit
to the same weakness on the part of the missionary.
But they fail to understand it; and the missionary's
power with them is very largely impaired by the
manifestation of this evil spirit. Even if impatience
were ever, anywhere, a virtue, in India it is always
an unmixed evil and should be guarded against.
The warning is the more needed because the tropical
climate itself is a very bad irritant to the nervous
system. Among the Hindus patience is regarded the
supreme virtue of God and of man; and it should
adorn every missionary who seeks to be their leader.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Humility also is a grace which needs much cultivation
by the missionary. He has constant temptation
to pride. The sin of masterfulness is naturally
his besetting sin; for his influence over his people
and his control in the direction of his work gradually
grow sweet to him and develop, if he is not very
careful, into an imperiousness of will which is neither
pleasant to those who come in contact with him, nor
consistent with the golden grace of humility, nor in
any sense pleasing to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Love—that essence of divine character—needs preëminent
guarding, encouragement and development
on the part of the missionary. There is so much that
is unlovely and unlovable all about him, so little to
attract and draw out his tender emotions that he
needs to drink freely from the fountain of love above;
or he will degenerate very easily into a hard, cold,
unsympathetic, cynical missionary—a frame of mind
which will utterly disqualify him for any joy or power
in his work. One of the best missionaries I have
known used to pray very frequently—<span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord, save
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
me from the sin of despising this people.”</span> It is a
prayer which every missionary may find it necessary
to offer frequently. True Christian love is none the
less necessary, yea the more necessary on the mission
field, because the missionary lives among people who
are not kindred in blood to himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then he needs also a large gift of faith and of
hope. The smallness of the Christian Church in the
midst of a dense mass of heathenism; the apparent
inadequacy of earthly means to convert that great
people to Christ; the slowness of progress and the
fewness of results—all these tend to depress and discourage
the worker. And he needs to offer for himself,
as for his people, the prayer which Elisha offered
in behalf of the young man,—<span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord, I pray thee
open his eyes that he may see. And the Lord
opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and
behold the mountain was full of chariots of fire round
about Elisha.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritual power, in all its forms, is not only greatly
needed by the missionary, it is also highly appreciated
by the people who are always ready to be led by it.
I believe that the people in the East are much more
amenable to this influence and much more ready to
follow spiritual guidance than are the people of our
own land. And this, in itself, is an added reason for
deep spirituality in the missionary.

World.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This attitude is one of considerable importance to
the missionary because it furnishes largely the motive
of his life work. Before one goes out as a missionary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he should acquire some definite and sound views as
to the condition of the non-Christians who constitute
three-fourths of our race. This means that he must
decide as to his missionary motive,—what motive
power shall impel him to leave his native land and go
to live among a benighted people surrounded by a
thousand disadvantages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since the organization of our missionary societies—less
than a century ago—there has been an important
change of emphasis in the matter of missionary
motives. The progress, I might almost say
revolution, in theology has worked towards this
change. The recent discovery of new sciences, and
the utilization of the wonderful modern means of
communication whereby a new knowledge of non-Christian
peoples has been made possible to us, has
affected our consideration of the whole problem of
missionary work and has especially modified the
missionary motive. Dr. W. N. Clark, in his admirable
book on Christian Missions, discusses fully this
question. <span class="tei tei-q">“The difference,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“between our
conception of man today and that of a century ago
is mainly not that something true has fallen out of it,
though that may be the fact with many minds: it is
rather that immeasurably much that is true has been
added to it. Unquestionably our conception of man
is still incomplete, unbalanced and incorrect, but it
certainly has been altered within the century by the
addition of much that must remain in any true conception.
Our knowledge must have experienced
true and legitimate growth and from our present
conception of the human world we can never go
back to that which our fathers held when they began
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the work of modern missions ... our thought
concerning our fellow-men contains elements of truth
and justice that our fathers knew nothing of. The
best Christian feeling towards the heathen world
today is far more true, righteous, sympathetic,
Christlike, than the feelings of those who were interested
in missions an hundred years ago. But the
single motive which, standing alone, led to the missionary
enterprise has come to be so surrounded by
other thoughts and motives as to lose its relative importance,
and be less available than it then was as a
controlling influence. This is one of the great and
significant causes of the crisis in missions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not necessarily true that the paramount motive
of a century ago is no longer believed; but that other
motives have grown and reached a commanding influence
as a power in the Christian consciousness of
today. A Christian missionary has indeed changed
his views, for instance, concerning the origin and
character of Hinduism. Through modern enlightenment
and the study of comparative religion no man
can go out as a missionary, even as I was expected
to go less than a quarter of a century ago, with a
general belief that that great religion is entirely of the
devil and is in itself evil and only evil continually.
The missionary of today must discriminate, must
study appreciation and consider historic facts. He
must know that ethnic, and all non-Christian religions,
have had their uses, and that some still have
their uses in the world. They are the expression of
the deepest religious instincts of the human soul.
And they have, especially such a faith as Hinduism,
not a few elements of truth which a missionary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should know no less than he should understand the
great evils which enter as a part of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The greatest missionary motive of today lies in the
last commission of our Lord which emanates from
the heart, and reveals the essence of our religion.
His command to his disciples to go and disciple the
nations stands now as the Supreme Christian Command;
and its significance is appreciated and emphasized
today as never before. And so long as a Church
gives increasing emphasis to this, His greatest commission,
it must necessarily be in the path of duty, of
privilege, of blessing and of power. Above all other
missionary motives this must remain supreme.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And there must go hand in hand with this loyalty
to Christ, a deepening loyalty to Christianity and a
growing appreciation of its uniqueness in the world.
Christianity is not one religion among many; it
stands alone as the soul-satisfying and soul-saving
faith. The scattered lights of other faiths find here
their centre, and all their prophesies find here fulfillment.
The need of Christianity, by all men, is
supreme. Whatever may be said in favour of other
faiths we must say of them that they are, in many
respects, perverted and are inadequate as a means of
salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in addition to this the missionary must feel
that all non-Christian peoples are in supreme need of
Christ, the Saviour. This fact we cannot afford to
qualify, without, in very truth, cutting the nerve of
missions. When a missionary regards Christ and
His mission and message as only an incident in the
life and need of our race and ceases to acknowledge
that all men need Christ supremely, he had better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
give up his work; for his missionary motive has lost
its foundation and his life work has been robbed of
its power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary is called to go wherever the
Macedonian cry of human need and of spiritual helplessness
is heard. Our Lord's command was world-embracing
in its extent; it was a discipling of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
nations; it was a call to be witnesses unto the uttermost
parts of the earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shall the missionary go and preach everywhere the
gospel of Christ, whether men invite him or not?
In view of recent events in China and in other lands
some people (and among them are a few well-meaning
Christians) question our duty and even our right
and privilege to carry the gospel to a people against
its will and when it is satisfied with its own faith.
They claim that this restraint is demanded by true
Christian altruism and by the spirit of Christ. That
the day has come when the Christian Church should
thoroughly reconsider the best methods of missionary
approach to such peoples I readily agree. I also
maintain that Protestant missions should everywhere
scrupulously avoid all Jesuitical methods and political
influences and should always strive to minimize, if
not ignore, their political rights and magnify the
spiritual side of their work. Under these conditions
no people has lent an unwilling ear to the missionary's
message, or, for a long time, failed to rejoice
in his presence and work. But had missionary
societies sent their missionaries only to those people
who invited them, or were prepared to give them a
cordial welcome, where could they have found work
or how achieve the magnificent success of the last
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
century? Imagine the great missionary apostle sending
messengers in advance to inquire whether the inhabitants
of Lystra and Ephesus, of Thessalonica and
Athens were willing to receive him, and turning
away his face because, forsooth, they were not prepared
to welcome him! The only invitation he did
receive was from Macedonia in a vision. The acceptance
of the invitation brought to him at once opposition
and stripes. Paul said that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knew</span></em> that
bonds awaited him wherever he went. But that did
not deter him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had our Lord Himself considered the attitude of
man towards Himself He would never have come
down to men. He came to fling fire upon the earth—to
bring not peace but a sword. He was despised
and rejected of men. Like Him, missionaries must
consider the deep spiritual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">need</span></em> and not the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em> of
a people. Above all, they must be assured everywhere,
in their great life work, that they are sent by
God rather than invited by men.

to the Missionary Society and the Churches
Which Support Him.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relationship into which a man, who becomes
a missionary, enters with the missionary society and
the churches is a very precious one, and should be
fully realized. In a peculiar sense he has become
their adopted child—the subject of their prayer and
the object of their pride. They have taken him into
their own heart and his support and success are their
peculiar concern.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is the connecting link between them and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work which they support and cherish in the far-off
land. Whatever of interest, of joy and of responsibility
they possess in that work passes through him.
He is to them the channel through which flow their
endeavours. He is the living embodiment of their
interest in the work as also of their effort to bring
the heathen to Christ. And in like manner he has
become to them the articulate cry of the heathen
world for help. He represents to them at the same
time both the progress of the work, its need and the
claims of a heathen world upon them. He is their
agent to develop and inspire their infant Mission
Church. He is also the almoner of their benevolence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all these capacities it is well that he remember,
constantly, how much he depends for inspiration as
for support upon those who have sent him forth to
the heathen and who, under God, sustain him and
his work. He should cultivate full appreciation of
their endeavour; he should keep himself in living,
loving touch with both society and churches; and he
should deem it his duty and privilege to furnish them
with all light and intelligence concerning his work.
It is thus that he must strengthen their faith and inspire
their hearts in the great and far-off work which
they are maintaining. It is his opportunity to add
fuel to the ardor and enthusiasm of all the churches
in the missionary endeavour. In this he has an important
function to perform and should endeavour to
magnify his office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In my opinion the relationship between the missionary
and those whom he represents at home
might easily be strengthened and improved by added
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
recognition and courtesy to him in the home-land.
At present the foreign missionary of the congregational
churches is simply regarded as their paid agent.
This relationship is indeed a pleasant and a cordial
one. The American Board is most appreciative of
the labors of its missionary agents and deals with
them generously. The churches also give them a
cordial welcome and a warm hearing. But the missionary
has no status whatever beyond this. He returns
for a furlough to the home-land and feels himself,
in a peculiar sense, a stranger. He has no
official connection whatever with his society; his
voice is not heard in its councils; his wisdom and
experience are not sought in its deliberations. In
other words, though possessed of a large stock of
knowledge which might be of value to the Board in
the shaping of its policy and in the direction of its
work at its annual meetings, he has absolutely no
voice or place there and stands apart from its organization,
beyond the privilege of being its foreign servant.
The missionary body has felt this deprivation
and isolation during critical periods in the history of
the Board; and it still feels that, at least some of its
number should be permitted both to enjoy the honour,
and also to render the service incident to being corporate
members of the Board.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The situation is no better in his relation to the
home churches. He is a member, probably, of some
church in the home-land; but, upon his return home
he has no status whatever in any Conference or Association,
or as a member of a Ministerial body
among his home brethren. In his deputation work
at home he finds welcome, as a stranger or as an outsider,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and not as a member or as an integral part of
any body or Association.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The position of the missionary is different among
the Methodists. Every minister of that body finds
that, by becoming a foreign missionary he does not
separate himself from home ties and privileges. His
ministerial connection is preserved intact, so that he
has a status in the churches and in the missionary
society.

Belongs.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a man becomes a member of a foreign mission
he soon realizes that he has become a part of a
compact organization. All its members are bound
together by the warmest ties of friendship and love.
Largely separated from the world and knit together
by common purpose as by all their highest ambitions,
they verily become a big family whose love increases
as the years multiply, and among whom the spirit of
dissension can only create the deepest sorrow and
greatest bitterness. It is, therefore, of the utmost
importance that every one who becomes a missionary
should be a man of peace; should know how to
live in harmony with all his brethren. He should
cultivate that spirit and should aim to see eye to
eye with those who are thus so intimately connected
with him. In loving sympathy they should unite
in the serious concerns of their life-work. One of
the first requisites demanded from a missionary applicant
from the American Board is that he be of a
peaceable disposition—able to live harmoniously with
others. And it is not only a suggestion that should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be heeded by every missionary; it is also a rule
which should be enforced by every missionary
society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Each mission has behind it a history, and, before
it, more or less of an aim and policy. It should be
the ambition of every member of that mission to
study and honour the one, and to be faithful and
loyal to the other. The history of most missions in
India is precious and full of instruction. They have
sainted heroes and most interesting traditions. The
missionary should not only study the records of his
own mission and draw from them every possible
lesson for his life; he should also enter heartily into
the spirit of the mission and endeavour cordially to
bring himself <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en rapport</span></span> with its highest wisdom,
deepest purposes and most cherished schemes for the
future. It is not necessary that he be satisfied with
all that the mission has done; he should also aim, in
the spirit of humility and of patience, to constitutionally
influence his brethren to his own new views and
better way of thinking, if he have any. Above all,
he should aim to conserve rather than to destroy.
The blessings of the past should be utilized in attaining
higher things for the future. Revolutionary
methods are ill-adapted to add blessing to such a
work. It should also be the aim of the missionary
to so further the work of his mission that it may
soon cease to be a necessity. A mission, at best, is
but a temporary thing. It should constantly aim to
so nourish and strengthen the native church as to
make itself unnecessary. And it should be the aim
of the missionary to hasten, with all speed, this consummation.

Among Whom He Lives.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having entered upon his work and settled among
the people of his choice, he must seek to realize the
best possible relation to them. This relationship will
be a varied one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He must be a leader of the Christian community.
In India, today, there is special need for missionaries
who are born leaders. The people of that land are
defective in the power of initiative; but they are
most tractable and docile. They love to follow a
bold and a wise leader of men. And the missionary,
from the very necessity of his position, should be
able to direct and guide the Christian community into
ways of holiness and of Christian activity. He is to
be a leader of leaders. He should marshal the mission
agents connected with him in such a way as to
lead the native Church into highest usefulness and
most earnest endeavour for the salvation of souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He should be strong as an organizer and administrator.
In missions the word organization is becoming
the keyword of the situation. There is no danger
of over-organization, so long as the organization is
endowed with life and does not degenerate into machinery.
The best organized activities of today are
the most powerful and the most useful. And the
missionary will find his highest powers for organization
taxed to the utmost in his missionary work.
And as an administrator there will be made many
claims upon him daily. I know of few qualifications
that are more essential to the highest success on
the mission field than conspicuous ability to organize
and wisdom to administer the affairs of a mission.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Missionaries frequently fail at this point and need
therefore to strengthen themselves in this particular.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A missionary should be as much the conserver of
the good as a destroyer of the evil which he finds
among the people. Much of that which he will see
in India, for instance, will at first, and perhaps for a
long time, seem strange and outlandish to him; but
let him not decide that it is therefore evil. The life
of the Orient is built on different lines from that of
the Occident. Many things in common life, in domestic
economy and in social customs will, and
must, be different there from what they are here.
Their civilization, though different from ours, has a
consistency as a whole; and we cannot easily eliminate
certain parts and substitute for them those of
our own civilization without dislocating the whole.
Therefore, it is often safer and better to conserve
what seems to us the lesser good of their civilization
than to introduce what seems the greater good of
our own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary must be careful to distinguish between
those things which are real, and those which
are apparent, evils among the customs of the people.
There are some customs, such as are connected with
the degradation of woman and heathen ceremonies
which are fundamentally wrong and must be opposed
always. There are others which seem uncouth and
unworthy, but which are devoid of moral or religious
significance. Of two missionaries, the one who
studies to utilize the existing good among the habits
of the people will find greatest usefulness. Some
waste their time, destroy their influence and minimize
their usefulness by a destructive way of attacking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
everything that is not positively good and beating
their head against every wall of custom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary should be a prophet to rebuke and
to condemn evil. He will find numberless evils on
all sides of him—in Church, in general society and in
individual life among the people. He must not hesitate
to use constantly his voice as a protest against
all forms of evil. This duty is the more incumbent
upon him as there are none among the people to protest
and to denounce the most flagrant, demoralizing
and universal evils of the land. One of the most
discouraging things concerning the situation in India
is, not the universality of certain evils, but the utter
absence of those who dare to withstand them and
denounce them as sins before all the people. Missionaries
have done more in that land to rightly characterize
certain gross evils and to call the attention of
the people to them than have any other people in the
land. And they have recognition for this. And this
prophetic function of the missionary must be exercised
with increasing faithfulness for the good of the
land and for the purity of the Church of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that country the missionary must also stand before
the people as their exemplar. He must represent,
not only Christianity at its best, but also the
civilization of the West in its purest and most attractive
garb. India has always greatly needed such
human types of nobility of character to encourage
and stimulate the people to a higher life. With all
modesty and due humility the missionary is called
upon just as much to live as he is to teach the best
that is found in his religion and in the civilization of
his mother country. In India, the life of the missionary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has spoken more loudly than his words. There
are millions in that land today, who, while they deny
and reject the teaching of the missionary, give him
unstinted praise both for what he is and for what he
has done for the country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The testimony of Sir William Mackworth Young,
Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab is only one of many
such;—<span class="tei tei-q">“I take off my hat to the humblest missionary
that walks a bazaar in India,”</span> he said, in a recent
public address, <span class="tei tei-q">“because he is leading a higher and
a grander life and doing a grander work than any
other class of persons who are working in India. If
the natives of India have any practical knowledge of
what is meant by Christian charity, if they know
anything of high, disinterested motives and self-sacrifice,
it is mainly from the missionary that they
learn it. The strength of our position in India depends
more largely upon the good-will of the people
than upon the strength and number of our garrisons,
and for that good-will we are largely indebted to the
kindly, self-sacrificing efforts of the Christian missionary.
It is love which must pave the way for the
regeneration of India as well as for the consolidation
of England's power.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The missionary must never lose this crown of glory
in India. He must hold it most precious and strive
to add to the glory which he thus reflects upon his
Faith in that land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thorough organization of any work is essential
to its highest efficiency. The Missionary
Department of the work of the
Christian Church should, therefore, be well organized.
As missionary effort expands, grows in
intensity and increases in power, it must find a
growingly efficient organization in order to adequately
express itself and to attain further growth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. A thorough Missionary Organization at home is
the first requisite in order to highest success. Thus
only can the missionary work abroad be maintained
and fostered; because, by this means only can missionary
ardour be kindled in the churches. A Church
which is not adequately marshalled for activity in
heathen lands will soon become self-centred and
will easily forget the claims, if not the very existence,
of the heathen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Foreign Missionary Society of well organized
efficiency has, up to the present, been the best agency
in the development and furtherance of the foreign
work of every denomination. And the day does not
seem near when this agency can be dispensed with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This missionary society should be in close touch
with the denomination or body of Christians which
has organized and maintains it. It should be plastic
to the touch and will of its constituency and should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seek in every way to be at the same time a faithful
exponent of the thought and ambition of the churches,
and a leader and a source of new inspiration and light
to them on missionary problems. This society should
scrupulously avoid, on the one hand, the danger of
too much independence and of a purpose to shape
the missionary policy of the churches; and, on the
other, the equally serious evil of dragging, or of declining
to move a step without the direct intimation,
command or leadership of the churches. There has
been a time in the history of the American Board
when the one evil constituted its danger; at the present
time it would seem as if the other danger seriously
threatened it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is of much importance that the foreign missionary
benevolences of a church should be wisely administered
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a whole</span></em>. When different missionary
societies of a denomination appeal, as they do at
present, to our churches for funds to support the
missionary cause in foreign lands, it is of great importance
that moneys received by these different
bodies should be appropriated wisely. They should
be brought together both for unity of results and for
economy of expenditure on the mission field. My
observation convinces me that, for want of a wise
union or correlation of our missionary agencies at
home the various departments of the work (of the
Congregationalists, for instance) on the mission field
are very unequally supported, and an unwise distribution
of the benevolences of the churches follows
as a result. A previous, full consideration, by a competent
general committee of finance, in America,
should be had of the needs of the various departments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of each mission and of the distribution of all
the funds collected for that mission by the various
societies; and they should be carefully distributed in
accordance with the urgency of those needs respectively.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These missionary societies should aim to cultivate
in the churches the spirit of missions as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian
principle</span></em>. Advocates of the missionary cause
strongly feel that the interest of the Church in missionary
work today is too little based upon the real
and fundamental principle of missionary work as a
necessity of the life of the Church itself, and too
much dependent upon exciting narrative, tearful appeal
and poetic romance. The cultivation of the
missionary principle and the inculcation of the doctrine
of the privilege and beauty of supporting missions,
apart from any impassioned appeals or tragic
events, is one of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">desiderata</span></span> of the Church today.
It is a morbid condition of the mind of the Church
which demands exciting narrative and hysterical appeal
in order to arouse it to its duty in this matter;
and it also tends to create a standard of missionary
advocacy which is neither manly nor sufficiently careful
to balance well the facts and data of missionary
work as it is found upon the field. There is considerable
danger of accepting, today, only that form of
missionary appeal which is directed to the emotion
and which abounds in mental excitement rather than
that which furnishes food for sober thought. The
consequence is that this advocacy is in danger of becoming
a producer of more heat than light—of more
emotion than intelligent conviction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The recent movement towards leading certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
churches to take up definite portions of the work in
foreign lands and to support, each a missionary for
itself, has in it much to commend it to our acceptance.
It certainly has the merit of definiteness in purpose,
work and prayer; and this brings added interest and
a growing sense of responsibility to each church
which takes up the work. If a man (or a church)
finds his interest in missions waning as a principle of
Christian activity the best thing for him, perhaps, is
to come into touch with a missionary or a mission
agent on the field. By supporting him or a department
of work conducted by him, and by being kept
frequently informed of the work which he is supporting,
new fuel is constantly added to that missionary
interest which thereby develops into zeal and
enthusiasm. The method has apostolic sanction and
partakes of the simplicity of primitive missionary
endeavour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this method should not be too exclusively pursued.
It should not interfere with a broader outlook
upon missions and a general sympathy with, and
support of, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em> work. And all of the work
should be done through the missionary society which
alone can rightly coördinate and unify the whole
work of the particular mission.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Faith Missions, so called, represent a genuine and
a worthy spirit among many of God's people today.
To them the somewhat lumbering business methods
of the large missionary organizations savour too much
of worldly prudence and seem subversive of the
deepest Christian faith. They maintain that the old
method is one that looks too much to men and too
little to God for support. And they also claim that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the missionary of such a society has little opportunity
for the exercise of highest faith in God both for himself
and his work. These new missions, therefore,
have come into existence practically, if not really, as
a protest against modern methods of conducting missionary
work. They may do much good if they exercise
some restraint upon missionary societies in
this matter. Probably it is needed. Many believe
that there is an excessive tendency among the
directors of missionary societies, at the present day,
to consider this great enterprise simply as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">business</span></em>
enterprise, and that, in the committee rooms, faith
has yielded too much to prudence, and the wings of
missionary enterprise have been too much clipped by
worldly considerations. How far their reasoning is
true, I will not decide. Their claim is not without a
basis of truth. The financial embarrassment brings
to the Missionary Society today, much more than it
used to, discouragement and a halt; with the result
that the missions are more than ever before crippled
by retrenchment and home churches are resting satisfied
with smaller attainments and are forgetting the
old watchwords of progress and advance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Faith Missions”</span> are created by and meet the
needs of a certain class of people in the church whose
spiritual life is intense and who crave romance in
faith and in life. The missionaries of these societies
tire of the great organizations of the church and are
usually men who are restless under any stiff method
or extensive system in Christian work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But very few such missionaries meet with permanent
success. The glamour of the <span class="tei tei-q">“faith life,”</span> so
called, does not abide with them. Few men have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the staying, as well as the supporting, faith of a
George Müller; and yet every missionary in this class
should be a hero of faith—a man with that special
gift and power from God which will maintain itself
and go on working under the most adverse circumstances.
And this is what the ordinary <span class="tei tei-q">“faith missionary”</span>
does not possess in an exceptional degree.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a matter of fact, <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith Missions”</span> are decidedly
wasteful of means in the conduct of their work. If,
in some ways, they practice more economy, in other
matters of greatest importance, there is deplorable
wastefulness. For, they are wanting both in continuity
and in wise management and sane direction.
As history has shown, they also easily degenerate into
very prudential methods and sensational forms of
advertisement which destroy the very faith which the
missions were supposed to express and conserve.
There is no less faith—rather is there more—exercised
by members of well-organized missions who
depend upon God's supply through the regular channel
of a society. For they can give themselves
entirely to their work of faith and love, confident
that God will provide for their wants and the wants
of their work; while the <span class="tei tei-q">“faith missionary”</span> has to
devote much time in anxious thought and in skillful
and dubious methods of appeal to secure the means
of support.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One only needs to look at India today and there
study the results of these two classes of missions in
order to see which method is the more economical
and the more owned of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Missionary Boards should keep in close touch
and living communication with the missions which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they support. The mission to which I have the
honour of belonging has not had the privilege, until
the last year, of receiving an official visitation from
any member of our Board for nearly forty-five years.
That a society should aim, by its officials in one city,
to conduct, for so many years, a mission among its
antipodes without having one representative among
its directors who has gazed upon that land, seen that
people or studied on the ground any of its problems,
seems remarkable, and wants in that sagacity which
usually directs us as a people. By frequent visitations
alone can such a society expect to be able to direct
wisely and lead successfully its missions. For, it is
highly desirable, both in the interests of the mission
itself, of the society and of the home churches that at
least some of the directors of the society should know
personally and well each mission supported through
them. At no greater intervals than five years such a
visitation should be planned for every mission. I am
confident that they would add largely to the efficiency
of our missionary work and increase the interest of
home churches in their foreign work. But such
visiting committees should be willing to learn and
should not come out with preconceived ideas of what
ought to be done, nor with bottled and labelled remedies
for all the ills of the mission. Some missions are
sore today because of a visitation many years ago,
since it was not conceived in the spirit of highest
wisdom and teachableness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The missions themselves also should be well
organized for work. The success of a mission will
depend, in no small degree, upon the character of its
organization. In India, today, there is a great variety
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of missionary organizations. They range from the
almost purely autocratic ones, established by Christians
of the European Continent, to the thoroughly
democratic and largely autonomous ones of the
American Missions. German and Danish Missions
are mostly controlled by the home committees of
their missionary societies. American Missions have
a large degree of autonomy in the conduct of their
affairs. British Missions divide equally with their
home Society the right and privilege of conducting
their affairs. It is certainly not wise that a committee
of gentlemen thousands of miles distant from the mission
field should autocratically direct and control, even
to matters of detail, the affairs of their mission. The
missionaries on the ground should not only have the
right to express their opinions, but should also have
a voice in conducting the affairs of the mission for
whose furtherance they have given their life, whose
interests they dearly love and whose affairs they are
the most competent to understand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor yet should a mission be entirely free from
foreign guidance and suggestion. Too much power
given to a mission is as really a danger as too little
power. It is well for a mission that it should have
the aid of men who have large missionary interests
under their guidance and who are in full sympathy
with home churches. The ideal mission is that
which, on the one hand, enjoys a large degree of
autonomy in the conduct of its affairs, and yet
which, on the other hand, is wisely supported and
strengthened by the restraining influence, suggestion
and even the occasional initiative of a well-formed
home committee.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation of the mission to its own members
should always be firm and its authority kindly and
wisely exercised. There may arise a serious danger
of too much individualism in a mission. A mission
which does not have a policy of its own and conduct
its whole work in harmony with that policy, and so
control the work of each of its members as to make it
fully contribute to the realization of its aims, will not
attain unto the largest success in its efforts. When
each missionary is given absolute independence to
develop his own work on his own lines it will soon
be found that whatever mission policy there may have
been will be crushed out by rampant individualism.
And when each man is at liberty to follow his own
inclination and to direct his work according to his
own sweet will, mission work will have lost its
homogeneity. Each section and department of the
mission will be changed in direction and method of
work upon the arrival of every new missionary; and
thus every blessing of continuity in work and of a
wholesome mission policy will be lost. I know of
missions (American, of course) which suffer seriously
on this account. I also know of other missions which
are seriously affected by the opposite difficulty. The
mission controls its work so completely, even to its
last detail, that it leaves to the individual missionary
no freedom of action and no power of initiative.
The mission, in solemn conclave, decides even the
character and quantity of food which must be given
each child in a boarding school conducted by one of
its missionaries! A control which reaches into such
petty details as this, is not only a waste of time to
the mission itself; it seriously compromises the dignity,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and destroys the sense of responsibility, of the
individual missionary. It takes away from him the
power of initiative and thus largely diminishes his
efficiency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ideal mission is that which gives to each of its
members some latitude for judgment and direction,
but which has a definite policy of its own and sees to
it that this policy is, in the main, respected and supported
by every one of its missionaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is an interesting fact, in the study of the missions
of India, that the American Missions, on the whole,
represent the largest degree, both of mission autonomy
and of missionary individualism. The farther we
pass east from America the more do we see mission
autonomy yield to the control of the home society;
and the independence of the missionary lost in the
absoluteness of mission supervision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How far shall missions give the power of franchise
to their lady members in the conduct of mission affairs?
The last few years has seen this question agitated
by many missions. They differ largely in this
matter. The Madura Mission has settled the problem
by giving to the women absolute equality with the
men. This, probably, is an ideal solution. But it
should be accompanied by a similar movement in the
missionary societies at Boston. The position at present
is anomalous in that mission; for while it has
given to both sexes equal rights of franchise and is
therefore a unit in administrative power, the societies
at home which support the general, and the woman's
parts of the mission activity are entirely separate
from and independent of each other. It is not too
much to hope that, at an early date, the relations of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the home societies may be changed towards unity of
action, to correspond with the present situation in the
mission field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation of missions contiguous to each other
in foreign lands is a subject which is increasingly engaging
the thought of all missionaries. In the past,
missions of different denominations lived largely isolated
from, and absolutely indifferent to, each other's
welfare. There was much friction and jealousy,
coupled with a readiness to disregard each other's
feelings and a willingness to take advantage of each
other's weaknesses. I am glad to say that that era is
gradually giving way to a time of better feeling, when
sympathy and appreciation, fellowship and coöperation
are becoming the watchwords. During the last
few years marked progress has been seen in India in
the line of amity and comity between the Protestant
Missions of the land. Recently, a large Conference
of Christian Missionaries was convened in Madras
representing the thirty-five Protestant Missions of
South India. Missions which formerly held aloof
from their sister missions and declined to fraternize
in any way with them, came on this occasion and
heartily joined in the universal good feeling and desire
for fellowship among all. Coöperation was the
watchword heard in all discussions at that great Conference;
and since that day increasing effort has been
put forth to bring several of the more nearly related
of these missions, not only into coöperation in work,
but also into organic unity. For instance the missions
of the Free Church of Scotland and of the Dutch
Reformed Church of America have met, through their
representatives, and have perfected a scheme of ecclesiastical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
union and of coöperation in work. And already
expressions of hearty desire have been made
that the missions of the Congregational denominations
unite with these Presbyterian Missions in this
Scheme of Union. I believe that it will require but a
short time for the perfecting of such a union among
all these kindred missions. Thus and thus only can
we hope to teach to our native Christians the growing
oneness of God's people; and thus also do we
hope to reduce considerably the expenses of the work
in that land. For, by thus uniting our forces, we
shall be able to reduce the number of our special institutions
for the training of our agency and the development
of our work. Nothing can further the
cause of economy in mission lands today more than
the union of mission institutions now built on denominational
lines and expensively conducted in all
the missions. I believe in denominationalism. It has
its mission in the world and has done much good.
But a narrow, selfish, denominationalism on the mission
field, and in the presence both of the infant native
church and of the inquiring Hindu community,
is one of the most serious evils that can befall the
cause of Christ in India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We should all pray for the day when all narrowness
in this matter shall yield to the broadest sympathy,
love and coöperation. And, perhaps, the best way
to answer our prayers in this matter is by furthering
the noble cause of Christian union among the denominations
and churches here at home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old illustration, taken from the rice fields of
South India, is apt and instructive. These fields are
small and divided by low banks. The banks serve
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the purpose of separating the fields of different persons,
of furnishing water channels and of facilitating
the irrigation. When the crops are young and low
every field is seen marked out by its banks. But as
the crops grow the banks are hidden and we see
nothing but one great expense of waving grain ready
for the harvest. So, while the useful, denominational
banks which have divided us in mission lands are
still there we thank God that they are being hidden
more, year by year, as the harvest of Christian love
and fellowship is approaching.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The organic structure of a mission in the early
stages of its growth is a very simple thing; as it
achieves increasing success the necessities of the
situation compel it to add to its efficiency by widening
its scope and increasing its functions and multiplying
its departments of work. A hundred years
ago, or less, as the missionary entered virgin soil and
began to cultivate a new mission field, he devoted
himself, almost exclusively, to the work of preaching
the gospel to the heathen. Presently the gospel
message found entrance into the hearts of a few and
they were formed into a congregation. At once he
began to train this infant congregation and selected
one or more of the most promising of its number for
special instruction and initiation into the duties of
Christian service. He then took this nucleus of a
native agency with himself on preaching tours until
new accessions to the faith were gained and new
congregations established. As the congregations
multiplied his work as an evangelist had to give
way, in part, to his efforts to train an adequate
native agency to guide and nourish the growing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christian community. There was also added to this
the pastoral care and superintendence of congregations
new and old. Later on he felt the need of
schools to train the young of his congregations; he
also began to realize the value of educational work
for non-Christians as a means of presenting to them
the gospel of Christ. Thus a system of schools was
gradually established, both for Christians and for
non-Christians which not only required his care, but
also demanded a force of Christian teachers adequate
to this increasing work. So, institutions for the
systematic training of teachers and preachers had to
be established. Under the influence of these schools
intelligence grew apace and was suitably met and
satisfied by a developing Christian literature—a literature
which met the needs of the Christian and
heathen alike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover as he studied the physical condition of
the surrounding people he was appalled by the prevalence
of disease and the inadequacy, yea, even the
evil, of the system of medical treatment which
obtained there; and so his heart was drawn out to
the need of making some provision for modern
medical aid. As the community continued to grow
and the number of young people multiplied, in
church and congregation alike, he became impressed
with the need of organizations whereby this latent
youthful power might be conserved, increased and
utilized for the Glory of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this way the primitive missions of the past have
actually developed into the powerful organizations of
the present. One must study, on the spot, one of
the larger missions of India today in order to appreciate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what a complicated organism it is. He then
will see how it has sent out its ramifications into all
departments of life and of Christian activity. It has
laid its hands, in organized power, upon every department
of Christian work which can be made to
contribute to the furtherance of the cause of Christ in
that field. In this way have come into existence the
following departments, which are represented in
more or less fullness in all the missions of India today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, as we have seen, is the oldest as it is the
most fundamental, of all organized missionary activities.
And it should retain its prominence in missionary
effort. It was preëminently the method of
Christ. He was the Heavenly Messenger proclaiming
that the Kingdom of God was at hand. He was
first of all the great Preacher; <span class="tei tei-q">“and the people everywhere
heard Him gladly.”</span> The missionary of the
Cross never feels that he is more directly in the footsteps
of his Master than when he is preaching to the
unchurched and Christless masses. There is to this
work a joy and an exhilaration which are peculiarly
its own, even though it is a work fraught with
physical weariness. I have felt, in the prosecution
of this work, more satisfaction than almost in any
other. Not that I regard it as the most successful
form of labour. It is not. Even as a direct
evangelizing agency, I believe that it must yield
precedence in India to school-work. The faithful
Christian teacher is now a more successful evangelist
in that land than the preacher himself. And yet the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preacher reaches and offers light and gracious opportunity
to the more benighted and the more
neglected members of the community. Without
making special choice of any favoured class he sows
broadcast the seed, preaches the divine Word, praying
that the Lord himself, who also preached to the
common people, bestow his richest blessing upon
the labour which he has done in his name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This work of preaching Christ to those who know
him not, must be carried on by missionaries and
agents. It is usually the custom to expect that every
mission agent shall devote some of his time in visiting
neighbouring villages and in gathering the people
together and in presenting to them, in all simplicity,
the message of salvation. Frequently these teachers,
catechists and pastors take with them some of the
members of their congregations to help them, by
song and by the influence of their presence, to present
their message effectively to the people; and thus
the Christians also receive a most useful training in
this elementary part of Christian service.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From time to time special itineracies are conducted
by a band of mission agents who will spend a week
or more in traversing a whole region, preaching in
every village and street as they pass along their
journey. These itineracies are conducted in various
ways, but are always most helpful in the evangelization
of the district.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of the best organized missions are adding
emphasis to this work by devoting missionaries
specially to the conduct of it. These men gather
bands of native preachers around them who spend
their time and strength in preaching and in disseminating
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
gospel truth in the neglected regions of their
fields.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theological seminaries also give a part of their time
to this excellent work. The seminary, with which I
am connected, gave, during the year 1900, five weeks
to village work. Teachers and students travelled
hundreds of miles among the villages of the neglected
part of the field and carried the message to more than
50,000 people. This was not only a joyful service,
it was also a most helpful experience to the young
students while undergoing their theological training.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, as the native Church, in a mission, grows in
numbers and in intelligence, the work of evangelism
becomes its special duty. If the Church does not
enter, with added joy and power, into this department
of its work; and if it does not voluntarily assume,
with ever increasing fullness, this form of
Christian activity, there is something radically wrong
about it. It should be the prayer and purpose of the
missionary that every church and congregation established
by him become a centre of evangelistic power,
whence will radiate divine light and heat into adjacent
hamlets and villages. I am glad to say that, so far as
my observation goes, the native Church is undertaking
this work with increasing zeal and with a growing
impulse from within, rather than by pressure
from without. In the Madura Mission, through the
Home Missionary Society and its auxiliaries, and
through the organizations of the native women, at
least eighteen men and women are being supported
for this especial work of evangelism. And the number
of members of churches, who engage voluntarily
in this work, is every year growing.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The character of this preaching is a matter of importance.
In India it should be, largely, if not exclusively,
constructive rather than destructive. Forces
destructive to a belief in Hinduism and its numberless
superstitions have multiplied wonderfully in that land
during the last fifty years. So that there is no necessity,
today, that the Christian preacher spend any of
his time in attacking the errors and evils of the
ancestral faith of the people. He should give himself
to the more agreeable and blessed work of imparting
the living truth of the Gospel in all directness
and simplicity. The destructive agencies of the
civilization, knowledge and religious institutions of
the West have accomplished their work and have
made straight the pathway of the Gospel Messenger
into the mind and heart of the people. Thus, it is
not the abuse of the old, but the exposition of the
new, faith which should occupy the time of the
preacher to Hindus today. It has been my own custom,
and I always urge it upon my students, to avoid
the temptation of attacking Hinduism, and to preach
a simple Gospel of salvation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rapidly increasing number of churches and
congregations has added much to the pastoral duties
of a mission. Formerly missionaries themselves
acted as pastors and shepherded the flocks in the
villages. Even today some of the German missions
have missionary pastors. But this is now exceptional.
Missions generally have learned that, for
native congregations, native pastors are essential.
They not only are better adapted, by nature and by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
training, to meet the needs of the native Church;
they are also the only ones that are within the range
of the financial possibilities of self-support. And
self-support must be ever held before the church as
a high future blessing and duty of the Christian community.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet the day when the pastoral work can be
effectively and satisfactorily done by the natives
themselves has hardly arrived. Few native pastors
today, and much fewer catechists, are competent,
both on the score of character and of independence,
to wisely direct the affairs of their people and to
efficiently preserve church discipline. This is a sad
confession to make; but truth compels me to make
it—a truth emphasized more than once by long experience
among them. A few years ago a church
within my jurisdiction wished to expel a leading
member whom it knew to be a godless man. He
had become a curse to the community, and nothing
but excommunication seemed wise or possible. I
visited the church for the purpose of assisting the
pastor in the administration of the Lord's Supper and
of studying the general condition of the church. And
we attempted, congregationally, to discipline this
member. The church was asked to vote, in case it
thought wise, to excommunicate the man; but not a
hand was raised. The matter was further explained
to them, and all those who were in favour of his expulsion
were requested to raise the hand. Again not
a hand was raised! The pastor, thereupon, explained
the situation by stating that the people were afraid of
the man and dared not vote against him even though
he was not present. The pastor was himself equally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
timid in the situation. Thereupon I asked those of
them who desired that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> should act in this matter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
the church</span></em> to raise the hand; whereupon every hand
of pastor and people was immediately raised; and I
fulfilled their wish by excommunicating, in their
name, the evil member!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This may or may not be Congregationalism; but it
illustrates the fact which I am now dwelling upon,
viz.: that for the present, both pastor and people are
unequal to the severe duties of church discipline.
Every month the missionary is confronted with similar
situations which reveal to him the necessity of his
presence as a superintending pastor and the urgent
need of his wisdom to direct the affairs of the
church, his firmness to put an end to many impossible
situations, and his inspiration to tone up and give
backbone to pastors and other agents connected with
him. It should not be forgotten that, while the infant
community connected with each mission has
many admirable traits of piety and of character, it is
still the victim of great weakness in matters of purity,
of fellowship and of Christian peace. So that if the
Church is to be preserved from many intolerable evils
and brought into the noble traits of a Christian character
which will impress itself upon the non-Christian
community there must be firm guidance, stern repression
of evil and wise inspiration to good on the part
of the native pastoral force under the bracing influence
of missionary guidance. To those who are
conversant with the condition of the native Church
in India there is a supreme conviction that its greatest
danger lies in the irregularity of the life of its members
and in its want of firm discipline and the preservation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of purity rather than in the fewness of
accessions from heathenism. Hence the importance
of the work of shepherding Christ's feeble flock in
that land. The training of suitable native agents for
this work is a duty of paramount importance; and
the training must be continued through their life by
the presence of the missionary to guide, restrain and
inspire.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In large, well-organized missions, the educational
department is now perhaps the most important and
all-pervasive. As a mission grows, this department
usually develops more rapidly than any other of its
organized activities. This work is divided into three
classes:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-div" style="margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
<a name="toc64" id="toc64"></a>
<h3 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em"><span style="font-size: 120%">Schools for Non-Christians.</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are especially established with a view to
reaching and affecting the non-Christian community.
They have developed wonderfully during the last
half-century and hold an important place in the
economy of missions. They represent the leaven of
Christianity in India. They are preëminently an evangelistic
agency. They furnish excellent opportunity
to present Christ and His Gospel of salvation to a
large host of young people under very favorable circumstances.
These institutions are of two classes—primary
schools in villages and high schools and colleges
at centres of influence and culture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They have been the object of attack from men of
narrow missionary sympathy and of limited horizon.
These men claim that money expended on such institutions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is a waste of mission funds. But they have
failed to recognize the significant fact, which I have
already mentioned, that these institutions undoubtedly
furnish the best opportunity for missionary
evangelistic work. And I fearlessly maintain that
more conversions take place, and more accessions are
made, through these schools than through any other
agency, apart from the Christian Church itself. Not
a few of the village primary schools become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nuclei</span></em>
to Christian congregations, which flourish and develop
into Christian churches. And through the
higher institutions some of the best and strongest
members of the Christian community have been won
from Hinduism. All this, apart from the fact that
these institutions perform an unspeakably important
function in the dissemination of light throughout the
whole Hindu community and in the leavening of the
whole mass of Hindu thought and institutions. The
good done by this class of institutions is beyond
computation in that land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the worthy ambition of every mission and
missionary to train the children of the Christians so
that they may rise, not only in intelligence, but also
in social life and position. Under this class of
schools the native Christian community is being
rapidly developed and educated, so that it is already
in advance of any other community in general
literacy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among these schools for Christians are industrial
institutions for the training of boys and girls in
manual labour. At the present time there seems to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a growing tendency to magnify this department of
work. These schools are given to training in carpentry,
blacksmithing, weaving, brass-work, rattan-work,
etc. The Germans have entered more fully
into this effort than any other missions in India. But
they are not loud in its praise as a department of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mission</span></em> work. It certainly has both merits and
demerits which we shall consider later.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the last decade a few missionaries have
launched out upon a new enterprise in the shape of
Peasant Settlements. One object of these is to train
the poor and improvident members of the community,
especially the socially submerged classes, to
habits of thrift, economy and independence. It is
also conducted as a philanthropy for the purpose of
raising the people socially and industrially through
new methods and forms of agriculture. This movement
is still in its infancy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the duty of every mission to train for itself an
efficient class of men and women who shall conduct
all the departments of missionary work and gradually
relieve the missionary of many of his duties. These
schools are of many kinds corresponding with the
various classes of agencies required.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This may be illustrated by the institutions now
found in the Madura Mission. Nearly every one of
the twelve out-stations of that mission has a boarding
school for Christian boys and girls. The best
students who graduate from these schools, especially
those who are deemed worthy to become future candidates
for mission service, go to Pasumalai and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Madura for further, and professional, training. At
Pasumalai young men may pass through the High
School and even the college department. They are
then placed in the normal department, to qualify
them as teachers, or in the Theological Seminary, to
prepare them as preachers and pastors. So, also,
girls are placed in the Madura Girls' High and Training
School and are there qualified for one of three grades
of teachership. Or they may be placed in the Bible
Woman's Training School where they receive a two-years'
course of training for work as Bible women.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only class of agents which is not trained by
the Madura Mission is that of medical assistants. I
trust that the mission's desire for funds to establish
this work also may be gratified and that thus we may
have the means of training suitable agents for every
department of our missionary work. No mission
can be complete unless it has some means of furnishing
itself with an efficient agency to conduct all departments
of its activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only danger connected with the excellent educational
department of work is, lest it should outgrow
and overshadow all other departments. This danger
is at present manifesting itself in some missions. It
is an attractive form of work which allures the missionary;
and, for several reasons, he yields to the
temptation of emphasizing it out of proportion to its
relative value and gives more time and money to it
than a wise place in mission economy demands.
The ideal arrangement for a mission would seem to
be to keep well in front its evangelistic and pastoral
endeavour, and to utilize all forms of educational work
with a view to strengthening and furthering these.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is true that certain missions, like certain individuals,
have a special genius or talent of their own; and
their highest success will depend upon their following
that bent. For instance, the Free Church of
Scotland, in South India, has shown eminent ability
and taste in the work of education. It has met with
distinguished success in that line of effort, and its
college for boys and high schools for girls in Madras
bear testimony to its eminent success in this department.
In evangelistic work it has thus far neither
shown much interest nor large aptitude. The Wesleyan
Methodists, on the other hand, are born evangelists
and find their chief success as preachers of the
gospel. Each mission should not only consider its
field and its claims and needs, it should also study its
own corporate gift and bent and then strive to develop
its work mainly upon those lines which are
most congenial to it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The creation and circulation of a healthy Christian
literature has always been recognized by our missions
as a work of paramount importance. While not
many missionaries have devoted themselves exclusively
to this work, yet not a little has been accomplished
in it by the missions. If not much that is
original and brilliant has issued from the missionary
pen; and if it stands sadly true that too few have
seriously undertaken this work; it is nevertheless a
cause of thanksgiving that Christian truth has been
extensively expounded and defended by them, and
that they have sent forth from the press a continual
stream of blessing to all the people.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In India, three strong societies aid the missions by
engaging directly in the production and dissemination
of Christian literature. These are the Bible Society,
the Tract Society and the Christian Literature Society.
These institutions have spent large sums of money in
the translation, revision and circulation of the Holy
Scriptures and in the furnishing of fresh, readable and
informing tracts and books in explanation, illustration
and defense of Christianity. The far-reaching results
of the work of these societies no one can adequately
estimate. The need of this department of work is
not only great, it is growing annually. Missions
feel this keenly and are unwilling to depend entirely
upon the above mentioned societies. Each mission
of any importance has one, or more, printing establishments
with which it can prepare and issue tracts
and books of its own, and whereby it may present
special truths and teachings which seem to it urgently
needed by its people. Through these presses the
missions publish also 147 newspapers and magazines
for the special use of the Christian people and others.
In this way forty-one printing establishments, employing
no fewer than 2,000 men, are utilized by the
Protestant missions of India in the production of
healthy literature for the furtherance of the cause of
Christ in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this department two special classes are kept in
view. The growing Christian community must be
provided with suitable books in the vernaculars.
Books devotional for the mass of Christians, and
text-books for the students in our professional
schools, and helpful books of instruction for the
large body of Christian agents are needed. All these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make an increasing demand upon the literary fertility
of writers and authors on the mission field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also a growing demand, and an urgent
need, for good books adapted to the non-Christian
community—such tracts and books as can present to
them, in an attractive and convincing way, the special
truths and the supreme excellence of our faith. The
number is annually increasing, both among native
Christians and in the non-Christian community, of
those who can read and whose taste for books is
growing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This method of approach to the mind of the people
has peculiar advantages of its own. The prejudices
connected with Christian instruction, as it proceeds
directly from the lips of the teacher or preacher, does
not exist in connection with tracts and books. These
printed messengers of truth and salvation quietly and
effectively do their work in the silent hours of the
night and in the secret recesses of the woods or of
the solitary chamber. And this message is the more
effective because it may be read and pondered more
than once, until its truth grips the soul in convicting
and saving power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The power of the printed page, as a Christian messenger
in India, is second to none at present; and its
influence will multiply mightily as the years increase.
Missions and individual missionaries should enter
more fully into this work; none needs increasing emphasis
more than this; and none has larger hopes of
preëminence in the great work of India's redemption.
Missionary societies also should devote more men,
than in the past, to the creation of a strong Christian
literature.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And even where missions are too weak to publish
anything of their own and are unable to write books
or tracts; there is a wide field of usefulness open to
them in a thoroughly systematic and energetic work
of distributing the existing literature produced by the
great societies. In some missions this work of circulating
Scriptures and Christian books has been reduced
almost to a science and has become an exceedingly
efficient help to the cause in those districts.
Other missions have yet to learn the importance and
blessing of this activity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This department of missionary effort has a wide
sphere of usefulness. Though not so urgently necessary
now as in former times in India, owing to the
ubiquitous and efficient Government Medical Department,
it is nevertheless popular and very useful.
This is specially so when the whole work and its
agency are brought into full subjection to the Christian,
as distinct from the purely humanitarian, motive.
No other department is more capable of being utilized
as an evangelizing agency; and in many missions its
influence is thus widely felt. Everywhere its aid to
other departments of mission work is much appreciated
through its ability to gain friends for our
cause among those who would otherwise be inimical;
and in preparing the hearts of many to receive spiritual
help from the Great Physician. No fewer than forty
hospitals, besides many dispensaries, are conducted
by Protestant missions in India today. Many of the
medical missionaries give their whole time to this
work; others conduct the medical as only one of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
departments of their missionary activity. To each
method there are advantages and disadvantages;
though, perhaps, the medical missionary finds greatest
usefulness when he gives himself entirely to his
profession as physician. But, in that case, he needs
tenfold caution lest the distinctively missionary idea
of his life-work should be subjected to, or lost in, the
professional and the humanitarian spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Medical work for women and children finds in
India today perhaps its most urgent call. There is
more need and suffering among them than among
men.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the first, missions have not neglected
woman. She has been their care, and her conversion
and elevation their ambition. But, in recent
times, much has been added to this. Not only have
separate and definite forms of work been opened <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em>
women; organized work <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em> women in their behalf
has suddenly taken high rank and attained considerable
popularity among Christian peoples. Under
Women's Missionary Societies fully 1,000 ladies have
come to India and are giving themselves exclusively
to work for their Indian sisters. All forms of effort
are undertaken in their behalf. Assisted by an army
of thousands of native Bible women, Zenana workers
and mistresses, these ladies perform their noble service.
Hindu homes are daily and everywhere visited,
and the seed of Christian life and truth sown; thousands
of non-Christian girls and young women are
instructed and initiated into the mysteries of Bible
truth and Christian life; and Christian womanhood
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is being developed, more rapidly indeed than
Christian manhood, into a thing of strength and
beauty. In the town of Madura alone thirty-one
Bible women have access to 1,000 non-Christian
homes where Bible instruction is gladly received.
Another staff of twenty-one Christian workers instructs
daily, in five schools, 500 Hindu and Mohammedan
girls. Also a High and Training school for
Christian girls, with 256 pupils; and a Bible woman's
training school, with seventeen students, complete
this organized work for women in that town. From
it, as a centre, seventeen other women visit and
work in seventy-two different villages and instruct
1,005 pupils. No work at present is more important
or finds more encouragement than this organized
activity for women.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ours is preëminently the age of youth—the time
when the importance of work for the young is fully
appreciated, and when manifold activities are put
forth by the Christian Church in their behalf. During
recent years such activity has been extensively
introduced into mission fields. In India at present,
Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., Y. P. S. C. E., Epworth
League, Sunday-school Union and a host of other
less-known organizations for the young have established
themselves and are working with much
enthusiasm. In former years little was done for the
young of the infant Christian communities. The
old Oriental idea that young people are of no account,
and that effort in their behalf is hardly worth
while, obtained in India until recent years. The consequence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was that the children of Christian congregations
were neglected and allowed to absent themselves
from Christian services and to grow up in
ignorance and heathenish darkness. As a result of
this many of these boys and girls, when they grew
up into manhood and womanhood, reverted to
heathenism; and many flourishing Christian congregations
of the last generation became defunct. It
is now understood, with increasing distinctness, that
the permanent success and growth of a Christian
congregation, as of the whole Christian community,
depends more upon the effort which is exercised
in behalf of the young than upon any amount
of labour lavished upon those of maturer years.
Hence, more activity, of an organized type, is
being wisely put forth in behalf of the children
and of young people. The more plastic, responsive,
tenacious mind of the young takes in more
readily, appreciates more keenly and clings with
more persistence to religious instruction and inspiration
imparted to it than does that of the older members
of the community. The Christian worker thus
finds earlier and greater fruit to his labour among the
young than among the old. Any enthusiasm imparted
by him to the young people is also, sooner or
later, apt to be carried by them to the older members
of the congregation or church. The hope of the
Church in India lies in the young people; and that
missionary, or native agent, who can best organize
the young into useful forms of outgoing Christian
activity, will do most for the Church of the present
and future. And, while so excellent an agency as
the Christian Endeavor Society is available for use in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this line of work, the missionary need not be discouraged,
but may feel confident that he has within
his power an organization rich in promise of blessing
to his whole community.

Native Christian Community.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every mission should encourage all forms of wise
and necessary organization for the furtherance of the
highest life of the community itself. And this chiefly
with a view to developing self-dependence in the
community. These organizations will be naturally
divided into two classes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Those Which Promote Self-Government.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christian Church in the mission field should
be organized ecclesiastically and administratively in
such a way that it may ultimately, and as speedily as
may seem wise, become entirely self-governing.
Every mission should aim to so teach the people that
they may control and conduct successfully their own
affairs. It should establish a Church which sends its
roots deep into the soil of the land and which will
become, in the highest sense, indigenous. One of
the necessary evils of missionary life is the early
Western control and guidance of everything. I
should like to see the day, when the native Church
can establish that polity which is most congenial to
its taste and run its affairs independently and on
Oriental lines, in such a way as to win more effectively
the people of India to Christ. The question is
sometimes asked,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Must our Congregational missions
bind, to our Congregational form of ecclesiastical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
government, the people whom they bring over
from heathenism? Must our church polity, in the
mission field, be Congregational, or Presbyterian, etc.,
regardless of its adaptation, or want of adaptation,
to the people?”</span> The affirmative answer has usually
been given by all societies (and wrongly I think) to
this inquiry; and thus every denomination transplants
into heathen lands, with renewed emphasis,
not only its own peculiar shibboleths of doctrine; it
also exalts to a heavenly command the government
and ritual which it represents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Missions in India are conscientiously endeavouring,
with varying degrees of wisdom and success, to lead
forward their people in the line of self-government.
But both love of power and a conviction of the inability
of the infant Church to wisely control its
affairs, combine to render this transfer of power
from the mission to the native Church a very slow
matter—more slow than seems wise to many besides
the leaders of the native Church themselves.
It is a significant fact, in India today, that the Methodist
missions, by their compact organization, are able
to, or at any rate do, confer more ecclesiastical and
administrative power upon the native Church than
any other mission; while Congregational missions—the
least organized—are the most backward in this
matter. A study for the causes of this would be
instructive.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Those Organisations Which Promote Self-Extension.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the first things that a mission should do,
after gathering the Christian community, is to organize,
in the community, such activities as are outreaching
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and self-extending. In the Madura Mission
there has been for many years a Home Missionary
Society whose aim is to help support weak churches
and also maintain a force of evangelists to preach to
non-Christians. It is the society of the native Christians—supported
and largely directed by them. It
has created, maintained and increased the interest of
the people in furthering the cause of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many such societies exist in India today and they
render valuable service in keeping before the mind of
the people the deepest characteristics of our faith and
the highest privilege of a Christian community—that
of outgoing love, and self-extending enthusiasm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Those Organisations Which Further Self-Support.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How extensively should the idea of self-support
be at present urged upon the native Christian community?
This is a question which we will discuss
later on. There is no question however but that
every mission should so organize its benevolences
that the infant Church may, at as early a date as possible,
cease to seek support from a foreign land; and
that it cultivate at the same time a spirit of self-denial
and of self-reliance. The poverty of the people is,
and will long remain, a serious barrier to this consummation.
But the evil of poverty may be counterbalanced
by a careful system whereby the benevolent
feelings, generous impulses and the sense of
obligation of the people are conserved, strengthened
and made fully effective. This matter should not be
left to haphazard or to spasmodic appeal. Every
Christian, even the poorest, should be so directed and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inspired in his benevolence that he may effectively
contribute to the worthy object of self-support.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">desiderata</span></span> of the native Christian
Church—self-support, self-propagation and self-government—are
to be desired above all other blessings
by the missions and should be sought with a persistence
and a well-organized intelligence, which will
mean advance and ultimate success. When these
three have been attained, missions, with all their expensive
machinery, may gladly disband and feel that
their end has been accomplished and that they are no
longer needed.

Every age has its own problems to solve; and
so has every department of life. The problems
which belong to missionary life, method and
work are many. The permanence and future success
of the missionary effort of the Church of God depends
upon the wise solution of these problems. Nowhere
is this more manifest than in India. In that land
Christian effort for the conversion of the people has
been made for many centuries by numerous nationalities
and Christian communities with varying success
or want of success. Unwillingness or an inability
to thoroughly confront and master the deep
problems of the field, the work and the people, with
a view to adapting Christianity to them has largely
been the cause of the slow progress of our faith in
that land. Successive efforts by the Greek, the
Syrian, the Romish and the Protestant Churches have
not been prolific in marked and permanent results,
simply because they have not adequately studied the
novel and strange conditions of the land and the best
methods of presenting Christ and His truth.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The initial and preliminary question as to the
right of the Christian Church to send forth its missionaries,
and to establish its missions in heathen
lands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This question is now raised by many. They ask
it because they believe in the integrity of the doctrine
of evolution. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you not,”</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“leave
those non-Christian peoples to work out their own
salvation through a natural evolution of their own
faiths? Let those old crude religions pass into something
higher through the natural process of evolution
rather than resort to the cataclysmic method of over-throwing
the old and introducing a faith that is
entirely foreign. Why not let the process of growth
work out its own results even though it takes a long
time for it?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This objection to our work is modern and thoroughgoing.
Of course it is equally pronounced against
supernaturalism in all its forms and ramifications.
It would be futile to reply to this by appealing to the
command of our Lord to go and disciple all nations.
It is enough to remind this objector that the doctrine
of evolution admits that the highest altruism is a part
of the evolution process. And if that is so, then the
highest Christian altruism must find its noblest exercise
in the work of bringing, by Christians to non-Christians,
those ideas and that life which they deem
the best and of which those outside of Christ stand
in urgent need. The highest evolution of our race
has been, and ever must be, through that Christian
altruism which will not rest until the noblest truth
and the fullest life are brought to all the benighted
souls of our race. Is not this the last message of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evolution to us at this present? And is it not identical
with the last commission of our Lord to His followers—to
go and disciple the nations? And while
it is the function of Christianity to maintain the evolution
principle of the survival of the fittest, it does
this by indirection—by seizing upon the most unfit
and unworthy and making them fit to stand before
God and worthy to enjoy the life eternal in all its
glory.

2. What shall a man or a mission entertain as a
motive or as an aim to be attained and as results

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This question also is based upon and will cover
very largely the character of the work accomplished.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two distinct and separate motives and
aims impelling Christians, at the present time, to
missionary effort. They are, in the main, an emphasis
given, respectively, to each of Christ's two
final commands to his disciples upon earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first instance his last commission to his followers
to go and make disciples of the nations is
taken as the watch-word; and this has always meant
thorough, patient, all-inclusive effort for the redemption
and elevation of all the races of the earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other class has taken as its watch-word our
Lord's last utterance upon earth—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall be My
witnesses.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Witness-bearing”</span> has become to
them the expression of the Church's great duty to
the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a great difference between these two
classes of aims and motives, and they are associated
with two classes of theological thinking. According
to the former theory the Kingdom of our Lord, under
the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, is to spread in
regenerating power and triumphant efficacy until all
the nations of the earth shall come under its sway.
This is a great and arduous undertaking. The planting
of this Kingdom in heathen lands and the discipling
of those people until the Church of God shall
have become a living and a self-propagating church
in all the regions of the earth is a work of ages,
worthy of the combined effort of heaven and earth.
And this consummation will surely take place. God
has promised it; Christ's work involves it; the Holy
Spirit came into the world for its realization. They
who entertain this belief are Christian optimists. No
reverses can daunt them; no opposition can discourage
them. They lay broad and deep the foundations
of their work and labour patiently but hopefully
for the great and final consummation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those, on the other hand, who are pessimistic as
to the triumph of the Kingdom of Christ under the
dispensation of the Spirit, maintain, with exclusive
emphasis, the Christian duty of witness-bearing.
They claim, in Dr. Pierson's words, that our mission
to the heathen world should be one of diffusion and
not of concentration; that we should bear witness
concerning Christ to the people who know Him not
and then pass on to others, rather than remain to expand,
to convert, to train and to establish living
churches. They maintain that our duty is preëminently
to bear witness to Christ, that we have no responsibility
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the conversion of the people and for
the building up of strong churches.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This claim that it is the duty of the Church to
herald the good news of redemption to all men as
speedily as possible apart from the expectation that
they will accept it: does not commend itself to me
either upon Scriptural grounds or upon grounds of
reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The idea of preaching the gospel to the heathen
<span class="tei tei-q">“for a witness,”</span> in the ordinary acceptance of that
term, does not constitute a worthy Christian motive.
Dr. W. N. Clark well analyzes this thought in the
following words, (page 53, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Study of Christian
Missions”</span>),—<span class="tei tei-q">“At the outset, there is one motive,
often, though not necessarily, associated with the
theory of heralding, that must be rejected as no
Christian motive. It is often held that in this rapid
work the gospel is not to be preached mainly in order
that it may be believed unto salvation, but rather <span class="tei tei-q">‘for
a witness,’</span>—which is taken to mean <span class="tei tei-q">‘for a witness
against,’</span> the hearers when they meet the judgment
of God. The hearing of the gospel marks a turning-point,
both in experience and destiny. When once
men have heard the gospel, they will be saved if
they believe, and justly condemned if they do not.
Only a few will be saved by the missionary preaching;
the elect will be gathered out of the mass, and
the many will remain indifferent. But the blame of
their ruin will be upon themselves, not upon God or
the Christian people; and it is to insure this result
that the gospel is preached to them for a witness.
But this is no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian truth</span></em>. Such teaching cannot
truly represent the motive of God the Saviour.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We must maintain that God acts in good faith in the
offers of His grace, or Christianity becomes a delusion.
We must preserve our own good faith also in conveying
the offer of grace, or our hearers will rise in
the judgment to condemn us. No allowance should
be made for any such unchristian motive in our plans
for Christian missions, and we must hold no theory
of missions that implies it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover the view is thoroughly pessimistic, so far
as this dispensation is concerned, and fails to realize
the power and the glory of Christian truth and of the
kingdom of Christ as inspired by the Holy Spirit. A
theory of missions which is pessimistic at the core
can hardly be a safe or an inspiring one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should be remembered also that missions are not
an end in themselves. They should aim at making
themselves unnecessary by the establishing of vigorous
churches which shall become self-extending and
indigenous in all the lands of the earth. The hope of
missions, and the hope of the world through missions,
lies not, ultimately, in the missions, but in the
churches which they establish. Therefore they should
be well established and patiently developed. The
Church of God must take up its missionary work
with a full appreciation of its supreme greatness and
difficulty. Let it not be supposed that it is called
simply to <span class="tei tei-q">“bear witness.”</span> This heralding of the
gospel of Christ, is only a part, and indeed a small
part, of the great duty of the Church to the world.
It is also specifically, and with greater urgency, called
upon to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disciple</span></em> the nations—to bring them into full
possession of saving truth and into joyful acceptance
of, and life in, Christ.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us not delude ourselves with the idea that this
work is easy, that we can pass over it lightly or that
we have no responsibility for the conversion of the
world. As I have preached for the first time to a
heathen village I have felt that my obligation to its
inhabitants for their salvation was thereby increased
rather than fulfilled. There is no doubt that Christian
missionaries realize today as never before the greatness
of the task set before God's people to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disciple</span></em>
the nations. The obstacles to it and the conflict
which it involves seem greater than ever. The
romance of missions has largely given way to sober
work and the rush of battle has been succeeded by a
great siege. This is preëminently the condition in
India today. Let us not forget this in our missionary
enterprise lest we lose courage by the way. But
let us also remember that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God's</span></em> work. He is
pledged to bring it to its ultimate triumph, and He
will do it. He will fulfill His promise and give to His
Son the heathen for His inheritance and the uttermost
parts of the earth for His possession.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em> theory of missionary work is the only one
that has produced, and can maintain, all the present
organized activity of the missionary Church. The
aim of the manifold activities and various departments
of missionary effort, as witnessed in India today, can
be nothing less than the ultimate conquest of that
land for Christ through the establishment of a living,
an ever-growing and self-extending Indian Church
there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now consider some of the problems which
specially exist in India.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Caste Problem</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The caste problem has been, and continues to be,
the most troublesome and obtrusive among all the
questions which confront missions in that land. It is
a more serious problem—more pervasive and intense—in
Southern than in Northern India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is radically different from social problems in
all other lands, in that it traces its source to, and gathers
its authority from, religion. It enforces all that
it sanctions by the most compact and relentless religious
system the world has known. It maintains
that men have been created into a great number of
castes or classes from none of which can they, by
any possibility, pass into another. In whatever social
stratum a man is born there must he live and die. It
is impious for him to attempt to evade or to violate
this heavenly classification. His interests and all his
rights are confined to that one caste of his birth. It
is sin for him to marry out of it or, in any way, to
transgress his natal compact with it. Neither added
wealth, growing culture, a new ambition, nor anything
else can enable him to change his caste. All
the forces of religion are directed, like a mighty engine
of tyranny, to bind him to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This sentiment of caste, after millenniums of teaching,
of rigid observance and custom, has become even
more than second nature to the Hindu,—it has grown
into a sweet necessity of his life, from whose claims
and demands he neither expects nor desires relief. To
the ordinary Hindu a change of caste would be as
unexpected, yea as impossible, as his sudden change
into the lower brute, or into the higher angelic, kingdom.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Christianity was first established in India the
problem of the adoption or the rejection of caste by
the Christian church had to be faced. It was rejected
by the earliest Christian community in India; for we
find no traces of it in the Syrian church on the coast
of Malabar today. Even caste titles, that dearest remnant
of that system to all other native Christians in
India, have entirely disappeared from that community.
It is a great pity that the history of that victory
over caste has not been preserved as a lesson and a
heritage to later Christians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Romish Church, which next invaded India, unfortunately
despised the Syrian community, sought
no instruction from its history, made a friend of the
caste system and adopted it in all its hideousness. It
did not wait to consider the terrible fact, so patent to
all at present, that Hinduism and caste are convertible
terms—that one cannot cease to be a Hindu who
maintains the caste system in its integrity. Its intention
was, no doubt, good in its way. It was an
effort to make an easy way out of Hinduism into
Christianity and thus to swell the tide of incoming
converts. But, unfortunately, the path was made
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">too</span></em> easy; the narrow gate was sufficiently enlarged
for the Hindu to enter with his burden of heathen
prejudices and superstitions, and it soon became the
highway of insincerity and hypocrisy. Moreover, the
Romish Church has found, to its cost, that an easy
way from Hinduism to Christianity is an equally easy
path to return. A man who carried much of his
Hinduism with him into the Christian Church was
easily drawn back by the remaining old ties and affections.
The consequence is that, while Romanism
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has made large inroads upon Hinduism in some
places, it has only been for a time; and the back-sliders
have been as numerous as the new converts;
so that Roman Catholicism has made little net progress
in India for many years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This alliance which Christianity made, four centuries
ago, with caste was, thus, a fatal one. It gave
also a clue to the earliest Protestant missionaries—a
clue which they, in a weak moment, decided to follow.
For, the first Danish missionaries also made a
sad compromise with this monster evil. I presume
that this may be regarded as a continental failing of
that day, when in Europe class differences were great
and almost insurmountable. Human rights and individual
liberty were not held so sacred, or so scrupulously
defended, in Europe in those days as they are
in Anglo-Saxon countries today. Otherwise any
alliance by the Church with the caste system would
have been an impossibility in India. Even today
some Protestant missionaries from the European continent
are found in India who defend the adoption of
the caste system by the Christian Church. How different
would have been the attitude of the Protestant
Church towards this heathenish institution had men
of the Anglo-Saxon type of today rather than Continentals
of two centuries ago started its work in South
India! In any case, the attitude of compromise assumed
towards the caste system in those early days
has led to interminable evil and to constant trouble in
the Christian Church in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After caste had first found admission as a friend
and then was discovered to be an uncompromising
enemy to Christian life and principles, much effort
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was made to expel it. Nearly all Protestant missions
now denounce it, root and branch, and preach
against it, and in various ways try to check and to
cast it out. But with no great success thus far. The
false step taken at the beginning has cost the Church
terribly. Today in South India more than nine-tenths
of all Protestant native Christians, while they seek an
alliance only among Christians, nevertheless marry
not on lines of Christian affinity so much as on Hindu
caste lines. It is not often that we find a man among
common Christians who has courage and sense
enough to seek a match for son or daughter outside
of the limits of that caste to which he and his people
belonged in Hinduism. This custom is found not
only extremely inconvenient and troublesome to
them; worst of all, it perpetuates, in the Christian
fold, the old heathen lines of cleavage. And thus
life in the Christian community is still running somewhat
in the old channels of Hinduism and largely
preserves those social distinctions of the past which
should have been buried with them at baptism and
forever abandoned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under these circumstances what should missions
do? What should be their attitude towards caste
spirit and customs? Through former misapprehension
and neglect the evil is in the Christian Church
and exercises a potent influence. How shall it be
overcome or expelled? Some believe in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">laissez
faire</span></span> method. They maintain that, if left to itself
for a time, it will die out, or the general spirit of
Christianity will naturally drive it out. The spirit of
caste is not exorcised in that way. So long as it is
perpetuated by marriage affinity, the source of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whole evil, and by habits of eating together on caste
lines, it will not diminish very much or cease to torment
the Church. A century of such waiting, in
some missions that I have known, finds the evil not
much diminished. It is only in those missions where
it is attacked and constantly denounced and its terrible
evils exposed, that progress is evident.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That which can do speedy and sure work, in the
destruction of this evil in Christian missions is inter-caste
marriage. And through this I am glad to see
that increasing good is wrought. Missions should in
every way encourage and put a premium upon marriages
among their members from different castes.
They should teach frequently and emphatically that
membership in different castes does not constitute a
prohibited marriage relationship; but rather does it
furnish the best ground for marriage. In this way,
and in this way only, will this wretched caste feeling
speedily die a natural death and Christians come to
marry, eat, sympathize, love and live on Christian,
rather than on Hindu, lines. A mission which does
not improve every opportunity to show its hatred of
the caste system and to antagonize it positively and
persistently can find no peace; nor will it find any
permanent prosperity. Missions are feeling this increasingly
and are acting accordingly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Self-Support of Missions</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every mission seeks, as its ever-present ambition,
to attain unto independence from all outside financial
aid and a thorough self-support of its own institutions.
We await the day, and believe in its no distant
coming, when a large number of mission
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
churches will entirely support their own institutions.
Indeed there are now many churches, on mission
ground, that have grown into self-dependence and
that maintain, at their own expense, all those normal
forms of work that are connected with Christian
activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question is frequently asked,—how far shall
missions place before them, as the supreme and immediate
aim, the self-support of their separate
churches? Among missions and missionaries there
are two tendencies in this matter. One class, represented
by the Church Missionary Society Mission in
Tinnevelly, place all moneys received from their mission
churches into one fund, and from this fund they
pay the salaries of the pastors and catechists, so far
as possible. Bishop Sargent told me that he did not
think any church should be allowed to directly support
its own pastor lest they consider that thereby
they had a right to exercise authority over him!
That mission, therefore, and for other reasons also,
has relegated the direct question of the self-support
of each church into the limbo of the undesirable.
In the American Madura Mission, on the other hand,
the responsibility is urged upon every individual
church to support its own spiritual instructor; and all
rules and methods are directed towards emphasizing
and enforcing this. Self-support thus becomes, in
that mission, its ever-present cry and the growing
ambition of its every church and congregation. And
the progress of the Church and of the mission is
largely measured by this standard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The self-support of a mission, as such, is a question
which is not looked upon with the same urgency,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or with the same idea of importance by all missions,
or by all missionaries. One party, for instance,
would make self-support the supreme end; everything
else must be subordinated to it. Nothing
should be undertaken, they say, which is not within
the means and the desire of the people to support.
For instance, they maintain that the salary of all mission
agents and the support of mission institutions
must be pecuniarily within the means of the Orient
and within the limits of its ambitions. I ought to
say that no mission, to my knowledge, carries out
this principle in its integrity, although there are some
missionaries who urge it and proclaim it at all times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other party believes that the principal duty and
highest privilege of a mission, as such, is not immediately
to seek self-support or to pare everything
down to the capacity of the people to give; but to
push forward the work energetically; with economy
indeed, but regardless of expense, knowing that vigour
and enterprise and a strenuous Western energy
today will be both amply rewarded in results and
will also set a pace for the native Church in coming
years. They therefore seek the best trained agents
regardless of the immediate ability of the people to
pay their salary. And they establish schools and
hospitals and various other institutions which are altogether
beyond the present ability of the Indian
Church either to found or to maintain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must not forget that self-support, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entire</span></em> self-support,
is possible in any mission from the very first
day of its organization, if the mission only makes this
paramount and has the boldness of its convictions to
shape its work according to the offerings of the people.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And there are some advantages to that method.
Many of the best missionaries have often felt that
they would like to try that system in India. Bishop
Thoburn, while maintaining that it would be impossible
to radically change the method of an old mission,
expressed the conviction that it might be well
to establish in India a new mission on the basis of
complete self-support from the beginning. This,
doubtless, was the Pauline method; and it operated
well under the then existing circumstances in those
lands. And had our missions in the East been established
and conducted by the Orient instead of the
Occident they would have had adequate patience to
pursue the method of self-support <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab initio</span></span>. But as
we are of the West, Western, our missions must partake
of the characteristics of our nature; and be imbued
with that energy, push, impatience for results
which distinguish us in everything. I am sure that
neither the churches at home nor their missionaries
abroad are prepared to limit their efforts by the poverty,
slowness and apathy of the East, and thus perhaps
delay for years, or generations, the results
which, through the expenditure of more money,
they possibly might reap today. The method which
missions have adopted is the western method, characteristic
of our haste and strenuous spirit, and partaking
of the evils incident to that spirit and method.
It is, on the whole, perhaps the best method that can
be used and fully realized by us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mission Educational Work</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In connection with the increasingly important department
of mission educational work in India not a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
few perplexing questions arise. We have seen that
this department has conquered for itself general recognition
as a legitimate part of missionary effort.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a serious conflict ahead, in the not distant
future. And this is in part owing to the attitude
of the Government Educational Department and of
the local governing bodies towards mission institutions.
There is no concealing the fact that most of
the English officials of the Educational Department
in India deem mission schools the most serious rivals
to, and regard missionary educators as quasi enemies
of, their departmental schools. These men have
recently assumed, and are increasingly assuming, an
attitude of jealousy, if not of hostility, to mission institutions,
chiefly because of their strength and excellence
as rival schools, and partly because of the Bible
training which is imparted to all the students of these
schools—a training with which those officials have no
sympathy and which they are wont to regard as an
educational impertinence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Missions must expect that the jealousy and the antagonism
of that department will increase. It is true
that the great State Educational Despatch of 1854 and
later enunciated government policy, declare that it
is not the purpose of the government to establish
schools of its own, except where private bodies fail
to do so; and that it is its purpose to encourage, so
far as possible, private institutions. But the general
declaration of the Imperial and Provincial governments
is one thing and the purpose and ambition of
its Educational Department a very different thing.
Departmentalists find it to their interest to strengthen
and increase government schools at all points; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as the funds appropriated for educational purposes
are inadequate for all schools they seek the lion's
share for their own, and grudgingly give an ever decreasing
quota to mission institutions. It will be an
ill day for missions when the Educational Department
and its schools will become sufficiently strong to affect
the policy of the general government as against
private, and in favour of government schools.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another fact, of equal significance, is the attitude
of District Boards and Municipal Commissioners towards
the schools of Mission Bodies. Nearly all the
members of Local Boards are native gentlemen.
They see the large influence of mission schools,
scattered as they are through their districts and
towns, and they regard them as Christian propaganda
and as evangelizing agencies; and it is but
natural that, under the impulse of their new nationalism
and of their interest in a Neo-Hinduism, they
should be jealous of mission schools which are the
rivals of their own indigenous and growing institutions.
And as they have the power of the purse and
make and withhold grants to different schools at their
pleasure; and as all the subordinate officers of the
Educational Department are natives and are not in
full sympathy with mission schools; it can be easily
seen how our schools are doomed to suffer through
an ever decreasing government aid towards their
support.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, there are two problems, in this connection,
which will confront us. One is the question whether
it be worth while for missions to conduct their schools
entirely at their own expense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>—without any government
aid. This problem must be faced ere long;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and it means either the curtailing of this department
of work or the expending of a very much increased
sum of money upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question may also be urged upon us, more
speedily than we anticipate (indeed it has been raised
already), whether any schools aided by government
shall be allowed to be used as religious propaganda.
In other words, whether mission schools shall enjoy
the privilege of teaching the Bible to all non-Christian
students in attendance, even against their will.
This question is exercising the mind of not a few
natives and others today; and it is claimed that the
present practice is contrary to the Royal Proclamation
of Religious Neutrality in the land. There is some
reason for this contention; and, under increasing
religious rivalry and jealousy, it may, at an early date,
lead to a crisis in mission schools. And the problem
may confront us as to whether we are prepared to
continue all our schools for non-Christians under
conditions which make it impossible for us to give
Bible, or even any religious, training in them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another serious problem, in this same connection,
is whether missions should conduct, to any extent,
educational work apart from other indirect aims and
purposes. In other words, how far, if at all, should
a mission give itself to the work of education, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>,
and not as a Christian training or as an evangelizing
agency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many at present maintain that education—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em>
education—is in itself a good and a blessing which it
is the business of a mission to impart, independent
of any direct religious instruction or spiritual training
which might be given through it. They maintain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that mission funds should thus be used for the intellectual
advancement of the people apart from their
Christianization. The majority, however, would
claim that a mission's educational work should be
conducted only so far as it can be the medium of
communicating religious truth, or only in so far as it
can be made a direct auxiliary to the Christianizing
of the land. This class would claim that no work
should be undertaken by a mission which does not
contribute to the Christianizing of the people as a
result distinct from their progress in civilization.
And it is here that these two classes of missionaries
take issue with each other. It is an important difference
in the conception of the Church's work in
heathen lands. As I shall consider this later I only
call attention to it here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another matter, of no little consequence in this
connection, is that of the amount of educational
privilege which a mission should furnish to its
people. President Stanley Hall has recently maintained
that, even in this country, many are educated
who should not be. They should, he says, be left to
the hoe and shovel. He claims that not a few are,
through education, spoiled for usefulness in the lowest
sphere of manual labour for which they were by
nature designed; while they are also disqualified for
the highest sphere of service and life. If this be true
in America it is doubly true in India. Many young
men and women in that land have had lavished upon
them the blessings of education to an extent that
was unprofitable both to them and to the cause.
They have received an education and training which
not only carried them away far outside the social
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
realm for which they were intended by nature; it
also left them incapable of doing the higher thing for
which they were intended by the mission.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is adequate excuse for this in the early stages
of mission progress. The greatest need of a mission
is a good, strong, native agency. And in its desire to
furnish this agency the mission, as well as the individual
missionary, eagerly seizes upon every boy and
girl who shows any signs of promise as an applicant
to be trained for missionary service. This same ambition
to develop, in intellectual power and in civilizing
progress, the young of an infant Christian community
so that they may adorn our faith and give an
honourable status to the community leads many a
mission to expend upon the education of its boys and
girls more than it will in its later and more mature
stage of growth.

6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Industrial and Economic Problem</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the last two decades there has been a
marked and strong tendency in Indian missions, as in
the home churches which support them, to still
broaden the scope of missionary effort by adding to
its directly spiritual, and to its educational and medical,
work, schemes for the industrial, economic and social
advancement of the people. This broadening of the
conception of the work of the Church in missionary
lands is a most interesting study. Less than a century
ago nothing that was not directly and intensely
spiritual in its character was regarded as, in any
sense, a part of missionary effort. To preach the
Gospel to the heathen, to establish and to train Christian
churches and to develop and direct a suitable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
native agency—this embraced the whole work of the
mission. Anything beyond this was considered illegitimate.
Subsequently the medical department was
introduced,—chiefly because of the example of Christ
Himself as the Great Healer. Soon the educational
work was begun, as a necessity in its elementary
stages, and it gradually grew until it has reached its
present manifold character and large proportions.
Then a few missions began to touch the industrial
problem and to establish schools for the training of
boys and girls in manual labour. Today that work is
finding much increased emphasis, and missions are
beginning to take up, in all seriousness, Peasant Settlements
as a means of lifting the people economically,
and of training them to habits of industry, and to found
villages as separate Christian communities. Schools
for the blind and for deaf mutes also have been established.
In fact all forms of philanthropic effort have
now practically been adopted by the missions of India
as legitimate forms of their activities. Indeed, it is
extensively proclaimed, what has long been strenuously
denied, that missions are not founded simply
to Christianize but to civilize and to elevate in all
matters pertaining to soul, mind and body, the people
among whom they are established.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is a broad question and an issue of fundamental
importance. It belongs to the very concept
of missions and is largely a question of aim and purpose.
The trend of the times is doubtless in
favour of the broader, humanitarian, philanthropic,
civilizing purpose of missions as against the deeper
and more exclusive, spiritual and Christianizing
end.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems to me to be a question whether missions
are ready for this change.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is also a very serious problem whether, in the
mission field, this modern tendency to extend and
broaden out is of the spirit of Christ and is a passion
to do good unto men in every department and sphere
of their life; or whether it is a degeneracy—a drifting
away from the lofty and exclusive purpose of soul-winning
and soul-saving down towards the lower
plane of earthly blessing and general philanthropy.
There is certainly a sense in which this widening of
missionary endeavour is a part of the broadening of
the Christian life of today and is in harmony with the
multiplication of the agencies of the Church at home
for the general betterment of the people and for preparing
them for the highest blessings of our faith;
and as such it is both commendable and encouraging.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand I know of no temptation that is
pregnant with greater evil to missions, at the present
time, than that connected with this multiplication of
what may be called the lower activities of missions.
The spiritual work of a mission must ever
remain its principal work if it is to succeed in the
highest sense. It is also the most difficult work. It
bears with it, often, serious discouragement to the
worker. And in times of discouragement it is a very
easy thing for a missionary, and for a mission, to
relax effort at this point and, as a compensation, to
seek larger results on the lower planes of social and
industrial activities and humanitarian and philanthropic
effort. These lower forms of activity are
exceedingly absorbing and distracting; and when a
mission enters extensively into them it usually means,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, I would almost say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> means, a withdrawal
of time and energy and of interest from its
highest spiritual work. A man or a mission has
only a certain amount of strength and money to devote
to his work; and if this is increasingly and extensively
expended upon the lower forms of philanthropic
effort, the higher, spiritual purposes and endeavors
must suffer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Basle Lutheran Mission of South India has
done more industrial work than any other mission of
that land. But the industrial department grew so
rapidly and became so absorbing that it was found
necessary to make a separate <span class="tei tei-q">“mission”</span> of it. It
has flourished as a commercial enterprise and is self-supporting.
But the leader of that mission informs
me that its blessings are questionable, in that it tends
to demoralize the people and renders little or no aid to
their spiritual work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I believe that a certain amount of endeavour,
by a mission, for the temporal good and social
betterment of its people is legitimate and desirable,
extreme care should be taken, in the present early
stage of progress, lest this form of activity become
prominent or dominant; and, above all, lest it, in
any way, interfere with the conviction concerning
the supreme importance and prime urgency of the
spiritual training and growth of the people. This
class of work can very easily, by changing the
people's ideas of a mission's aim and purpose, demoralize
them. It can also, with equally fatal
facility, transfer the interest of the missionary from
the higher to the lower realm of work, and thus become
a curse, rather than a blessing, to him. If the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work of missions is to be broadened the greatest care
must be exercised lest this breadth be secured at the
expense of depth of spiritual purpose and power,
and height of spiritual life and experience. I must
confess that this new movement, in the present stage
of the progress of missions, brings to me as much
fear as it does hope. For, while I see reason for taking
up such work, I know also the demoralizing influences
that so naturally and easily follow it. A
mission that allows itself to be secularized, by giving
too much emphasis to these social and civilizing
agencies, becomes inevitably paralyzed as a spiritual
force in its field; and woe be to any mission that
gains anything at the expense of its spiritual paralysis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mission Administration</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question of administration is an exceedingly
important one to every mission. How wisely are
our missions organized for large economy of money
and effort and for highest efficiency? Could not
missions unite, for mutual counsel and wisdom, as
many officers of our societies at home now do; could
not missions learn more from one another in this
most important respect? The annual expenditure of
more than one million dollars on mission work in
South India alone is in itself a large trust which requires
great care and breadth of wisdom. Hitherto
not much has been done by the many missions of
India to learn from one another the wisest methods
of administration. There is remarkable diversity and
even contrast among those missions in the methods
of conducting their work and in the administration
of their affairs. This is, in no small part, due to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
different peculiarities of the several nationalities
which conduct the missions; it is also in part due to
their denominational affinities. But, by growing
familiarity with one another's methods and by more
appreciative study of the same, much could be
learned by these missions which would tend to
increasing uniformity of administrative method,
efficiency of work and abundance of results.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another question of perennial interest, in this connection,
is that of the extent to which native Christians
should be allowed to participate in the administration
of the affairs of a mission. The training of
some of the highest members of the native Christian
community in the responsibility of missionary administration
is a serious duty of every mission. The
day must come when the whole administration of the
Christian work carried on by missions will be in the
hands of the native community itself—when missions,
as such, shall have accomplished their work
and shall be disbanded. What is being done by our
missions today to make that consummation possible
and desirable at the earliest moment? Most missions
maintain that Indians should have nothing to do with
the administration of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign</span></em> funds. Is this a wise
position to take? Is it consonant with the best training
of the highest native Christians for future control?
In other words, what administrative preparation
is being made by the mission for the incoming
of an indigenous, self-governing Church?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is true that Indian Christians will not, for a long
time, be able to render much assistance to the missions
in this line. But if they are to be, at any
future time, capable of undertaking the responsibility
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the work they must be trained for it; and this
training must be conducted with patience by the
mission. If they are now wanting in independence
and poise of character and breadth of horizon, these
can come to them only through an extended training.
And it is the duty of missions to give this training to
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is danger that missions cling too tenaciously
to their right to rule. Power is sweet to the missionary
no less than to other men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am glad to say that progress is made by missions
in this matter. Slowly but surely the native Christian
is entering into their counsels and is finding increasing
opportunity and responsibility there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Problems Concerning New Converts</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are many interesting and important questions
connected with the reception of new converts
into the Christian fold in India. Some of these have
a growing interest to the Cause and have found an
important place in missionary discussion. I shall
refer to only a few of them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shall polygamous converts be received into
the Christian Church?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Hinduism polygamy (more especially, bigamy)
is not uncommon. It is permitted and indeed fostered
by that faith and is legalized by the laws of the
country. As our faith makes increasing inroads upon
that religion, numbers, and yet never a large number,
of those who have two or more wives will accept
our teaching and, with all earnestness, seek admission
into our Christian communion. What shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we say to such? How shall we meet them and their
desire? This question has, in a few cases, been sent
to the societies at home, the missions seeking from
them advice and guidance. From America the instruction
has been received against receiving any
such into the Christian Church. This is natural
enough from a country which is confronted by the
Mormon question. But the problem has its Eastern
bearing which is not understood in the West and
which has led missionary bodies in India almost invariably
to decide in favour of receiving such into the
Christian fold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the consideration of the problem many things
must be kept in mind. None more important than
the claims to a cordial welcome from the Church of
any man who, in true faith and Christian earnestness,
seeks admittance. If it be demanded of the man that
he put away all but one of those wives taken in
heathenism; then we ask whether it is Christian, or
even just, to cast away one to whom he was solemnly
and religiously pledged according to the laws of the
land and with whom he has been linked in love and
harmony for years and from whom he has begotten
children? And if he is to put away one or more of
his wives, which one shall it be? Shall it be the first
wife? Certainly that would not be Christian. Or
shall it be the second wife who is the mother of his
children and whom he probably married at the request
of the first, who was childless, in order that he
might raise seed unto himself? It is not easy, on
Christian grounds, to decide such a problem as this;
nor is it very Christian to put a ban upon any woman
who, in accordance with their religion and their country's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
laws, has formed this sacred alliance with a man
and has lived with him for years. Nor can it be right
to brand with illegitimacy the children born of such a
wedlock.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would not allow such persons, received into the
Christian Church, to become officers of the Church.
But I cannot see why there may not be an humble
place in the Church of God for such and their families.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Should the baptism of a person, in any case,
immediately follow his confession of Christ?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This question does not pertain to those who live in
Christian communities and within the circle of Christian
light and influence. It refers mainly, if not exclusively,
to those who accept Christ under the influence
of Christian teaching at heathen festivals and
who may live far away from Christian communities.
In North India, some of those who have accepted
Christ under these circumstances have received immediate
baptism and have been sent back to their
villages professing Christians. At first sight this
seems unwarranted and unwise. Men who have received
and made an open confession of Christ under
these circumstances have not likely received a sufficient
knowledge of our faith, or attained an adequate
familiarity with its truths; nor have they been
grounded in its principles and life, sufficiently to warrant
us in the hope and assurance that they will continue
this life in their heathen homes and do honour to
our cause and the name of Christ which they have
professed. And yet who are we to decide adversely
upon the application of such a man who may find, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
think he finds, in that public occasion the only opportunity
of making an open confession of Christ? And
what right have we to conclude that he will not stand
firm to his pledge and promise if we are convinced
that it is made in all sincerity and earnestness, and if
we are convinced that the man has really accepted
Christ as his Saviour? Or, more properly, what
ground have we to believe that the Holy Spirit cannot
carry on to perfection the work thus begun by Him
in the heart of such a man? And was not this method
of immediate baptism that of the Apostolic Church,
even though many thus baptized subsequently denied
their new faith?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, doubtless, cases of this kind where baptism
cannot be refused by the minister of God—where
it is even imperative and may prove a blessing
to the heathen audience as well as to the new convert.
And yet, the ordinary method of delay and
careful scrutiny and training should still be adhered
to as a normal method of the Church in heathen
lands. It is the safest way to lead to a healthy and a
strong Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Another question frequently asked is that
concerning secret baptism.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shall a missionary, at any time and under any circumstances,
secretly baptize such as are anxious to
make confession of Christ, but are debarred by family
opposition, or by similar causes, from public baptism?
This problem frequently arises in connection
with work for heathen women. Under the influence
of the work of a Bible woman, or a lady missionary,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a woman may abjure her faith, accept Christ as her
Saviour and yearn for baptism. But to be baptized
publicly and to confess Christ before her people
openly would inevitably result in her being driven
from home, separated from her children and people,
and robbed of all opportunity to influence them in
behalf of her newly found faith. Moreover, by this
public confession she is deprived of all family support
and becomes a helpless dependent upon the mission
for her daily bread. The question rises whether such
a woman should be quietly baptized and thus left to
pursue her way in her own home and with her family
as a pledged, but secret, follower of the Lord. There
is much to be said in favour of, as there is against,
such a baptism. Many contend that such an acceptance
of Christ would be unworthy and would be
robbed of its saving power. But such are not conversant
with Hindu life and some of its terrible conditions.
Some would maintain, perhaps with more
wisdom, that it would be better not to baptize such,
but to encourage them to believe that they are accepted
of Christ and to treat them in every way as
Christ's own disciples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another problem in this connection is as to the
right or wisdom of an unordained lady missionary to
administer this initiatory rite to such women converts.
This question, of course, will be largely decided
in accordance with the ecclesiastical connection
of those who consider it. There is a growing number
of persons who believe that it would be well that
ladies be authorized to administer this rite under such
circumstances.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Another problem is connected with the revival
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of thought among the people of India whom we seek
to bring to Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This revival is really the result of western influence—largely
the product of Christian teaching and activity
in that land. In its last analysis it is therefore
not to be deplored, but rather to be welcomed. At
the same time this new awakening seems to be, for
the present, connected with a reactionary and a militant
spirit. It speaks in the interest of a new nationalism
and a false patriotism which extols everything
Eastern simply because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> Oriental. Its aggressiveness
is manifest even in America. We are becoming
familiar, in this country, with the yellow-robed Hindu
monk who has probably been trained in a Christian
mission college and who talks Hinduism with a
strong Christian accent. Though he has violated a
peremptory command of his ancestral faith in crossing
the seas; and though, of necessity, he daily tramples
in this land the whole decalogue of Hindu life and
ritual, he feels competent to champion Hindu philosophy
here! And he seems to find a coterie of admirers
and quasi disciples in this land of light and
privilege! Recently an old classmate of mine informed
me, with all solemnity, that Eastern thought
is now invading the West; and that he himself had
become a theosophist! I have, since hearing this
statement, travelled considerably over this country
and confess that his statement does not seem so absurd
as at first I thought. For, I have seen the recent
phenomenal spread of Christian Science and of other
vagaries with which we are too familiar in this land.
What is Christian Science but the subtle, evasive
idealism of India unequally yoked to a form of Christian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truth and ritual. What is theosophy, but the
stupefying philosophy and the benumbing metaphysics
of the East, clothed in its own garb of
Oriental mysticism and senseless, spurious occultism.
It is a sad reflection upon our Western life that so
many people who fail to find rest in the divinely inspiring
teachings of Christ, sink into the depths of a
credulity which will accept the inanities of Madame
Blavatsky and the wild assumptions of Mrs. Eddy.
Let these people go out to India and live there for
years to see how Hindu thought and teachings have,
for three millenniums, worked out their legitimate
results in the life of the teeming millions of that land.
Let them observe the debasing immorality, the hollow
ceremonialism, the all-pervasive ignorance and
superstition which rest, like a mighty pall, upon that
people and which make life mean and render noble
manhood impossible. The situation in India reminds
one of the legendary house built upon the banks of
Newfoundland. The foundation was completed
when a dense fog swept over the place and rested
upon all. After the superstructure was built and
finished the fog lifted and it was found, alas, that
the building was erected some two hundred yards
away from the foundation, and rested upon nothing!
Whatever one may say about Hindu thought and
philosophy as a basis of conduct, that people have
been living for many centuries in the dense fog of
ignorance, superstition and ceremonialism; and their
life has been unworthy and debased because it rested
upon nothing.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is another form of this awakened Eastern
thought which invites our attention and which concerns
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the missionary work not a little. It appears
there in a reactionary form among men of culture and
leads many of them to turn away in hearty disapproval
from our faith. They are wonderfully drawn
towards Christ, our Lord. His praises are in their
mouths, and they eagerly study his example and life.
They claim him as one of the East and, therefore, as
one of themselves. But these same men will have
none of Christianity, because it is, as they say, of the
West, Western. One of their number recently wrote
an article under the following caption:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Why do
We Hindus Accept Christ and Reject Christianity?”</span>
He claims that they reject our faith because it is <span class="tei tei-q">“not
Christianity but Churchianity”</span>; that is, it savours of
the Western Church more than it does of Christ.
There is a great deal that is false and foolish in this
contention; and yet it has an element of truth in it.
We, of the West, have not realized, perhaps we
never can fully realize, the great width of the gulf
which, in thought and life, separates the Occident
from the Orient. Hence we have in part failed in
the duty of adapting our faith, in thought and ritual,
to the taste and inherited bias of that people. We
forget that they and we usually approach things
temporal and spiritual from opposite sides. They
are deeply mystical and poetic, while we are obtrusively
practical and meanly prosaic. Thus the Western
colouring and emphasis which is given to our
faith in that land can neither be appreciated nor approved
by the educated Hindu. Even native Christians
are bemoaning this fact. I shall never forget
the eloquent appeal which the Hon. Kali Churn
Banerjee, a leading native Christian in that land,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made before the Bombay Missionary Conference,
begging the missionaries to cease emphasizing, as he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“adjectival”</span> Christianity and to dwell more
upon <span class="tei tei-q">“substantive”</span> Christianity before the people of
India. It is a sad fact that we carry there our Western
shibboleths, our antiquated controversies, and our
sectional jealousies. Most of these are not only unintelligible
in India; they weary the people and
largely bury the essentials of our faith from public
gaze and appreciation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question returns to us with a new emphasis
today,—How much of our Western Christianity can
we eliminate and how much must we retain in order
to present to that people the gospel in its simplicity
and saving power? How much of our modern
Christianity is the product of Western thought, interpretation
and life, and how much is of the very
essence of Christ's message? We have yet much to
learn and are to be overtaken by many surprises in
this matter, I believe. God forbid that we should
rob our message of one tittle of its essential truth.
But may He enable us to discriminate more and more,
and lead us to cease encumbering our gospel to the
East with such unessential thought and ritual as are
suited to us but not to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I doubt whether we of the West can accomplish
this—it can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fully</span></em> done only when the Christian
Church in India shall have become indigenous and
strong, and, when freed from Western influence and
leadership, it shall do its own thinking and shape its
own ritual and ceremonial on Eastern lines. Then
indeed shall we behold that welcome and mighty
movement which will draw completely the culture
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of India into the Christian Church. Then also, and
not until then, shall we begin to see the Indian Church
contributing her share to the Christian thought and
life of the world. We, of the proud West, are prone
to think that our type of life is all-embracing and that
our religious thought is all-satisfying. Nothing can
be more fallacious or more injurious than such a conceit.
The East is the full complement of the West.
In life and thought we are only an hemisphere, and
we need the East to fill up our full-orbed beauty.
The mystic piety of India will correct our too practical,
mundane view of things. The quiet, passive
virtues which find their perfect realization in that land
we must learn from them to accentuate in addition to
the more aggressive and positive virtues of the West.
All this is to take place in the no distant future. The
Kingdom of Christ in the East is to reach out its
hand to the West and both, in mutual helpfulness,
will coöperate in bringing this whole world to Christ.
Then shall we see a universal kingdom and the beginning
of the fulfillment of the blessed vision in
which <span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdoms of this world have become
the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and He
shall reign forever and ever.”</span> God hasten the day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are occasionally compelled to read and
to hear detailed and emphatic statements
about <span class="tei tei-q">“the failure of missions.”</span> An increasing
number of our countrymen spend their
vacation days in hurried trips through mission fields.
They are so impressed by glimpses of the strange life
and institutions of the Orient that they have neither
time nor inclination to study and appreciate the missionary
work and organization which everywhere
invites their attention. They return home absolutely
ignorant of the work whose power, prevalence and
progress they might easily have learned on their
travels, and they are wont to hide that ignorance behind
the emphatic assurance that <span class="tei tei-q">“there was nothing
to be seen”</span> of missions; and they soon convince
themselves, and not a few others, that what they did
not see was not worth seeing or was, perchance,
non-existent. I have long lived on one of the great
lines of travel in India and have sorrowed over the
fact that hardly one in ten of our travelling countrymen
(and many of them members of our home
churches too) turn aside for a moment from gazing
upon Hindu temples to study the important work
which our mission is carrying forward in that city
and district.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even the friends of missions should learn what
constitutes missionary success.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In South India there is found a mission which
counts its converts only by the hundreds. It is
known in Christian lands only through the severe
criticisms which have been heaped upon it by some
good Christian men because it is an educational
mission.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet I sincerely believe that that abused mission
is doing a work not inferior to that of any other mission
in India for the permanent growth and highest
achievement of the Kingdom of God in that land.
Its leavening influence upon Hindu thought and institutions
is hardly surpassed by that of any other mission.
In the wonderful turning of the educated
classes of India towards Christ, and the acceptance
of him as their Ideal of life, that mission has a position
of power. Many of the native Christians of
greatest influence, culture and character in South
India trace their conversion or highest efficiency to
the work and influence of that educational mission.
The best educated pastor in the Madura district came
from and was trained by that mission; as also its
highest and best Christian teachers received their final
course of training and discipline there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That mission is largely ignored and even despised
by the too common statistical reckoning of results
and success. And yet the illustrious name of Dr.
Miller, the leader of that mission, will be cherished in
India and in the world a century hence as a chief
among those who were instrumental in bringing that
great people to Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mighty and unparalleled revolution which is
going on in India at present, as a result of missionary
work, is not to be tabulated in our statistical reports.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The deepest currents of those great moral and spiritual
forces of the India of today are not found within
the realm of figures. They defy tabulation; and yet
they bring to the keen Christian observer in that land
more encouragement, because they have more significance,
than all the facts and figures usually found
within the covers of an ordinary mission report.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great deal of the discouragement and pessimism
about missions today is born of this statistical craze.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us therefore take a broad view of the work of
our missions and study some of the results achieved—results
which are almost entirely the harvest of the
labours of the last century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These results are threefold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Present Missionary Appliances</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Protestant missions in India have created a
plant and have developed appliances which are not
only an assurance and a prolific source of encouragement
for the future; they are also monuments of the
industry and wisdom of those who have passed on,
and definite signs of God's guidance of, and blessing
to, the work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place, consider the buildings and other
property erected and owned by the missionary societies
and utilized for the maintenance and furtherance
of their work in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Few people realize the enormous store of wealth
which is thus treasured in this elaborate mission plant.
Nor can they appreciate the equivalent of this in terms
of moral efficiency and spiritual power in the regeneration
of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thousands of acres of land and the many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thousands of substantial edifices erected and dedicated
to the cause of Christ in connection with these
missions represent an investment of at least ten
million dollars; and this money not only represents
the generosity of Christians in the West, it also includes
the self-denying offerings of Indian Christians,
who from their poverty have given liberally to build
up the cause which is dear to their hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mission educational institutions are housed in a
legion of substantial and beautiful buildings ranging,
from the massive imposing structures of the Madras
Christian College, downward; churches there are of
all sizes and architectural design, from the magnificent
and beautiful stone edifice which accommodates
its thousands and which was erected by the Church
Missionary Society in Megnanapuram, Tinnevelly,
down to the unpretentious prayer-house of a small
village congregation. A host of suitable buildings
for hospitals, presses and publishing houses, residences
for missionaries and native agents, school
dormitories, gymnasia and lecture halls; Y. M. C. A.
and other societies' buildings—all these represent
that power for service, incarnate in brick and mortar,
which is invaluable and even indispensable to the
great missionary enterprise in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Nor must we overlook or fail to estimate adequately
the results achieved in the form of a Christian
literature. Though our Protestant missions have not
cultivated, as extensively as they should, the press
and the publishing house as a missionary agency, they
have not been insensible to their power and have
utilized extensively the printed page.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place a translated and a well-circulated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bible has been the aim and pride of our missions
from the beginning. The humblest native of that
land can find, in his own vernacular, the Word of
God, and read for himself the message of God in
Christ Jesus to his sin-burdened soul. Who can
realize the work involved in all this, or the achievement
which it represents?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the Christian hymnology of India is already
a rapidly growing power. Every important vernacular
has one or more Protestant Christian hymn
books, which reveal to what a large extent our faith
has inspired and made vocal the praises of Zion in
that land. Nearly all of these Christian hymns in
South India and many in North India are the compositions
of native Christians and manifest considerable
poetic power and high sentiment. Though
many of them are worthy of translation, only two
have thus far found place in our American hymn
books. One is a Tamil hymn composed by Yesuthasan,
catechist, and translated as below by Rev. E.
Webb,—

Besides this there is an ever-growing mass of
Christian literature in all the vernaculars used by our
missions; and this is becoming increasingly available
as a power for the uplifting of the people who are,
in growing numbers, learning to read. Beyond
almost every other appliance for the Christianization
of that people there stand high in usefulness and
pervasive influence these books, tracts and magazines
of the missions; and the aid which they furnish to all
Christian workers in that land is beyond computation.
Missionaries may go and come, and mission policy
may change, but this Christian literature will quietly
and mightily work out its own benign results throughout
the land, enlightening the people and appealing
to the best that is in them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) In like manner the missionary educational institutions,
which cover the whole land as a great network,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are a noble product of missionary ideals and
efforts in the land. They are in themselves an
achievement which not only has cost millions of
rupees for its creation and maintenance, but is also
the product of some of the best thought and highest
wisdom of many choice spirits during the last century.
These schools constantly furnish to the Christian
Church in India, for intellectual upbuilding, for
moral guidance and for spiritual regeneration, nearly
a half million of the brightest youths of the land.
These institutions are the product of a century of
endeavour; and it can be truly said that without them
the Protestant mission of India would be shorn of
much of their power and more of their promise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the present organized activity of missions there
stands nothing in higher esteem than these institutions
for what they have done in the life both of non-Christians
and of Christians alike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) In connection with missionary activity in that
land one of the most encouraging, as it is also the
most monumental, of results, is the large army of
well-educated and thoroughly equipped men and
women who have been taken from among the people
and have been trained and placed as their leaders and
guides.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps 20,000 such (there are 10,550 in South India
alone) are at present giving all their time and strength
to the spiritual training of the Christian community,
to preaching to non-Christians and to the instruction
of the young in the schools.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India is to be brought to Christ and his religion, not
through the efforts of the foreigner, so much as
through the life and activity of men and women of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the soil. They are to be the essential factor in the
future prevalence and in the character of our faith in
India. Therefore it stirs one to deepest emotion to
behold this mighty army of native workers, who are
praying and working daily in that land for the conversion
of their own people and for the upbuilding
of the Christian community in all that is characteristic
of our faith. As I have been permitted, for years, to
train and to send forth into that great harvest field
young men to preach the gospel of Christ and to
guide the churches and congregations into spiritual
truth and life, I have felt that it was the highest and
best opportunity that could be granted to any missionary
worker in that land. This work of training
an adequate spiritual agency is occupying the serious
thought of all missions. There are 110 theological
seminaries and normal training schools in the country;
in these, 4,305 students, of both sexes, are undergoing
training.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many of the agents now employed are men and
women qualified to clearly expound the truths of our
faith to believers and unbelievers. They are well
fortified against attack as rational defenders of Christianity
and are prepared to remove doubts which may
arise in the minds of sincere inquirers and wavering
believers. Not all of them are such as we could
wish in intellectual equipment or in strength of character.
But the poorest of them are gradually being
replaced by better ones; and the intellectual, moral
and spiritual tone of the whole force is constantly
improving. The ordained native clergy are a body
of men who are rapidly growing in efficiency and
power. There are 406 of them in South India alone—nearly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as many as there are ordained missionaries
in the same area.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A comparison, in South India, between this force
of 406 native pastors and the 585 native priests of
the Romish Church shows how well, relatively, the
Protestant Church of South India is supplied; there
being one native pastor to every 1,500 of the Protestant
community, while the Romish priests are only
one to every 2,000 of their community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of these pastors are university graduates, and
all are men of good professional training. They are
faithful workers and are increasingly worthy, and enjoy
the confidence, of their missionary associates.
Among the native agents of our Protestant missions
in South India alone there are about 100 university
graduates, 200 First in Arts (the degree granted after
two years of college work) and 600 university
matriculates. This thorough utilization of a strong,
cultured, native agency is one of the most striking
results of the last century's work in that land. And
it is the more remarkable in the case of the women,
since a generation ago hardly any of the weaker sex
were in mission employ, while today the missions of
South India alone employ 3,000 of them. It is practically
the creation of a mighty and most faithful and
devoted agency in one generation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What may we not expect from this great army of
native brethren and sisters, as they shall continue to
grow in numbers and in general equipment, and as
they shall be filled with the Spirit of God and be
fully used by our Lord in the redemption of their own
people!

Of the above number of Christians 2,664,359 are
natives of India. This is an increase of over 630,000,
or about thirty-one per cent, of Indian Christians
during the last decade. And during this time the
general population of India has increased only about
two and one-half per cent.! Analyzing this aggregate
of all Christians we find that 970,000 of them are
native Protestant Christians. This represents an advance
of sixty-four per cent, during the last ten
years in that community; while the Romish and Syrian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
native Christian communities have gained hardly
three per cent, in the same time. Thus it will be
seen that the rapid progress of our faith in that land
of the East depends almost entirely upon the remarkable
advance of Protestantism among the people of
India. This is certainly a result most encouraging to
Protestant Christian workers in that land. That this
decade's growth is not abnormal is attested by the
fact that the native Protestant Christians of India are
more than ten times what they were fifty years ago.

In view of the fact that the whole Christian community
of India is only one per cent, of the total
population, one may be inclined to feel discouraged.
And yet if the relative growth of the whole population
and, say, of the Protestant Christian community
for the last decade be maintained for one hundred
and thirty years more, the whole population will be
found Christian of the Protestant type.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These figures indicate the magnificent development
of our work in that land. And when we remember
the splendid equipment and wonderful modern appliances
of the missionary organizations of today we
can easily believe that, even within another century,
Christianity will become the prevailing faith of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A large number, in our Christian community, has
been gathered through mass movements, where certain
castes and classes have, in large bodies, sought
the blessings of our faith. In Tinnevelly, for instance,
the Shanar caste was early influenced by
Christian workers; and, as they are a very clannish
community, many thousands of them have embraced
the Christian faith and have been wonderfully transformed
and elevated through their contact with it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most marvellous manifestations of the
power of the Gospel is presented today in that district
by this people, who, under missionary influence
and Christian training, have risen from great depths
of ignorance and social degradation until they stand
among the highest of that land in intelligence and in
the spirit of progress. Most of the Christians of
Tinnevelly belong to this once despised class and
are, in many respects, full of vigour and enterprise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the famous Telegu Baptist Mission we find a
similar movement. That American Mission laboured
for twenty-five years without much encouragement.
After those years the outcastes of the community
began to appreciate the advantages of our faith and
to apply for admission into its congregations. It
gathered them in by thousands until it has become
by far the largest mission in the country. It represents
nearly one quarter of the whole Protestant
Christian community of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the last few years a similar movement has
overtaken the American Methodist, and other missions
in North India. Many thousands of the depressed
classes, within its area, have sought a refuge
from their ills and a Saviour for their souls in the
Christian fold; so that it taxes all the energies and resources
of the mission to keep pace with the movement
and to instruct adequately, in Christian truth, these
ignorant masses who flock unto it. Bishop Thoburn
says that more than 100,000 of this class are now
waiting to be received into their community; but
that their mission has not the men or means to instruct
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In other missions, also, reports are being received
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of similar movements now going forward on a
smaller scale. Some missionaries of these fields
have written to me stating that the only limit to the
growth and development of their missions is that of
men and money wherewith to instruct and properly
direct the people who come seeking for light and
help.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the great majority of missions, however, growth
has been general and normal; people have come as
individuals and as families, separating themselves,
after much thought and prayer, from those who are
dearest to them upon earth, and passing through a
sea of tribulation and persecution into the Christian
life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been claimed by Hindus, and by some others,
that Hinduism is a tolerant faith—that it does not resort
to persecution. In one respect this is true. As
we have before seen, it will permit its members to
hold any doctrine and to accept any teaching that
they please. It has no punishment nor even a voice
of disapprobation to its member who is a rationalist,
an atheist, or a Christian so far as acceptance of such
belief or non-belief is concerned. And, so far as
conduct is concerned, a man may be a libertine, a
robber or a murderer, and yet maintain his religious
status. But when it comes to the violation of caste
rules it is very different. Hinduism will tolerate anything
but caste insubordination. So that when a
man, in becoming a Christian, severs his connection
with his caste and becomes, socially, an alien to his
people, then Hinduism steps in and brings to bear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon him all the bitter penalties of caste infliction,
and persecutes him in a thousand social ways such as
make life a burden unto him. The engine of caste is
the most complete and mighty instrument of religious
persecution the world has known, as many thousands
of our native Christians have learned to their bitter cost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a man decides to become a Christian there
is very little opposition to this purpose among his
people so long as his decision involves only his belief,
conviction and private devotion and prayer. But
when it leads him to a public confession of Christ
and to baptism, which is regarded as his renunciation
of caste rules, affinities and obligations, then all
the spite of caste tyranny is showered upon him.
He is boycotted thoroughly. None of his caste people,
not even his own Hindu family, will eat with
him. The family and caste washerman is no longer
permitted to serve him; their barber will not shave
him, and the blacksmith, carpenter, mason and other
village servants decline to render him their wonted
service. So that he is absolutely helpless. It requires
a very strong man to face all this kind of annoyance
and deprivation, and to stand firm in the new life
upon which he has entered and continue loyal to the
new faith which he has embraced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be admitted that such rigours of persecution
are not carried out in all cases at present. Though
this is the spirit and method of caste, yet the influence
of home ties and family affection and the social
position and influence of a new convert may be such
as to mitigate this public opposition to his Christian
decision. But the engine of persecution is there,
always ready for use.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question has often been asked as to the motives
which animated those of our Christian community
who denied their ancestral faith in order to
become Christians. In this land many have an idea,
in some cases expressed but in many unexpressed,
that most of the Christian converts in India are what
are denominated <span class="tei tei-q">“rice Christians.”</span> This charge
against the adherents of our faith in that land is as
unworthy as it is untrue. That some embrace our
religion and take upon them the name of Christ from
unworthy motives we know—perhaps this is a thing
not confined to India. But it has always been a surprise
to me, not that so many, but that so few, join
our missions from worldly or unworthy motives.
For they soon learn that the missionary of their district
is a friend of the poor and the oppressed; and
they are constantly suffering from the injustice and the
rapacity of Brahmans and of other members of their
own faith who are above them. Outside of slavery
there are few people who are subject to grosser injustice
at the hand of men of wealth and of power
than are the poor, down-trodden people of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of them are also groaning in the deepest pit
of poverty. Poverty is a relative term. As compared
with India, America knows absolutely no
poverty. The poverty of India is crushing, over-whelming.
When we remember that according to
government statistics, the average income of a man
for the support of his family in India is less than
$1.50 a month we get a glimpse of what abject poverty
means.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when we further remember that, during many
months and seasons of his life, even this is partly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
denied him, owing to frequent droughts and other
unpreventable evils, we know in part how an unsatisfied
craving, and pinching distress overwhelm a
large proportion of that population. Government
statistics show that one-fifth of the population are in
a chronic state of hunger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet I heartily bear testimony that comparatively
few of our people have become Christians in
order that they might receive physical and temporal
blessings. We dare not say that this motive does
not exist; but we are confident that in three-fourths
of our converts it is not the prevailing or the dominant
motive. There is a soul-hungering and a heart-thirsting
in India such as are not in any way satisfied
by their ancestral faith. And Christianity appeals to
the people increasingly as a soul-satisfier and as a
power of God unto salvation; and they more and
more realize this fact and are impelled more by that
motive than by any other in transferring their allegiance
from Krishna to Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And even when some do come with prevailingly
low and sordid motives and seek to be enrolled as
members of the Christian community, we dare not
discourage or deny them; because we hope soon,
after they have united with our community and have
placed themselves under Christian instruction, to impart
to them loftier conceptions of life and of truth.
And even should we fail to reform them and to give
them worthy views of our religion and of their relationship
to it, we entertain the hope that their children
will become worthy and genuine Christians.
Many of the best and most honoured members of our
community, today, are the children and grandchildren
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of very unsatisfactory Christians of the
past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I might say here that missionaries are being frightened
less and less by the charges so frequently made,
by those who know the situation least, concerning
the unworthy motives of those who become Christians.
Indeed, to be frank, the question of motives
is, in my opinion, one of very little consequence,
save as it may involve down-right hypocrisy or gross
deception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ordinarily we do not expect, from a people who
have been brought up in so selfish and so debasing
and sordid an atmosphere as that of the common
Hindu of today, a highly spiritual, or a purely ethical
motive in becoming Christians. If such be the prevailing
motive, or even if we are convinced that it is
not absent, we are satisfied. Nor can there be anything
wrong if a man in India seeks alliance with
Christianity in order to better his earthly circumstances.
This may mean a purpose to secure an
education and the blessings of civilization and culture
for his children; or it may reveal a desire for relief
from injustice, or protection from gross tyranny; it
may signify merely a vague hope that, by becoming
a Christian, the general circumstances both of himself
and family will be improved. There is nothing
intrinsically evil in any of these ambitions nor in
seeking Christian affiliation largely with a view to
obtaining these, provided always that there is also a
conviction of the moral and spiritual excellence of
our faith and of its ability to satisfy the soul's need.
And this we may generally assume in a man who
voluntarily severs his connection with the faith of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his ancestors, and from a religion which was a part
of his own deepest life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor should the deep ignorance of many of those
who become Christians lead us hastily to conclude
that, because they know so little about our faith,
they therefore are unable to appreciate or enjoy any
of its spiritual blessings. I have often been surprised
to see how many very ignorant Christians, and those
who greatly try our patience at times, both by their
stupidity and their crooked lives, nevertheless often
reveal beautiful touches of a genuine faith and of a
most direct and simple trust; and they stand nobly
firm under the most trying and worrying persecution
which Hinduism knows too well how to inflict
upon those who desert and deny it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has often been charged, with a view to discredit
missionary effort in India, that the converts gathered
into the Christian fold have been from the lowest
social stratum, and not from the higher and ruling
classes of society. Even if this charge were entirely
true, I can see in it nothing reflecting upon the success
of our cause in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has, indeed, in all ages and lands, been the
normal process of Christian conquest, to gather in
the lower classes first. It is not by filtering downward
but by leavening upward that Christianity has
been wont to enter and to transform nations. As
this was the initial method in apostolic days, so has
it continued through all the history of the Church.
It has been by the weak and despised things of the
world that our Lord has brought to nought and then
won the mighty. It is so in India. Perhaps three-fourths
of the native Christians of that land are from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the non-Aryan community—from the aboriginal
classes over whom the sway of Hinduism is less
complete than it is over the Aryan races. This is
doubtless one reason why two-thirds of all the Christians
of India are found in Southern India—among
the Dravidians, who, as we have seen, are more the
children of Demonolatry than they are of Brahmanism.
And yet, let it not be supposed that the Turanians of
the South are far inferior to the Aryans of the North;
or that the salvation of the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“aborigines”</span>
of India, of whom there are more than sixty millions,
is unworthy of our highest ambition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither let it be thought that Christianity has not
made glorious inroad upon the middle classes and
even upon the highest class in that land—the Brahmans.
It is true that, thus far, not very many of
that high and haughty caste have openly professed
Christ. It is equally true, however, that some of the
best members of our Christian community are converted
Brahmans. The Indian Christian community
is proud of such men as the Hon. Kali Churn Bannerjee,
Dr. K. M. Bannerjee, Rev. K. C. Chatterjee,
Rae Maya Das and the Hon. N. Subramanien, not because
they were Brahmans, but because they have
consecrated to the Lord all their distinguished ability,
and because they excel in their possession of Christian
graces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These names, and many others like them, reveal
the growing power that our faith is wielding over
men of position in that land. At the coronation of
King Edward, in London, twenty representatives of
the Indian Christian Church were present. Of these,
six are ruling princes; perhaps the most distinguished
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of them is Sir Harnam Singh Ahluwalia, K. C. I. E.
He is a man of culture—<span class="tei tei-q">“a true representative of
educated India.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was entrusted by the Indian Christians to convey
their address to the king upon the occasion of
his coronation. Sir Harnam Singh's usefulness and
success largely depend upon the support, which
he receives, in all good things, from his wife,
Lady Singh, who is the daughter of Rev. Golak
Nath.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The devout Henry Martyn, nearly a century ago,
with mingled discouragement and yearning, declared
that to see one Hindu a real believer in Jesus would
be something more nearly approaching the resurrection
of a dead body than anything he had yet seen.
The illustrious Jesuit missionary, the Abbe Du Bois,
mourned that, even after a long period of faithful
work, he believed he had seen no genuine convert to
Christianity in that land. How would those two
great friends of India rejoice today were they to see
the glorious harvest which Christianity has been permitted
to gather during the last century from that
great people! And among the best of them are to
be seen not a few representatives of the haughty
Brahman caste and also members of the crushed and
despised outcaste Pariah community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is well to remember that it has been the ambition
of missionaries in India, not so much to gather in
numerous accessions from the social and intellectual
aristocracy of the land, as to create out of the Indian
Christian community, however degraded may have
been its origin, an aristocracy of character and of true
culture. And in this they have achieved remarkable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
success. For the native Christian community is being
most rapidly transformed in these respects.
Remember, please, the condition, previous to their
embracing our faith, of those outcaste people who
now constitute three-fourths of the Christian community.
They were not only socially ostracized,
and therefore wanting in all traits of manly assertion,
of independence and of self-respect. They
were also in deepest ignorance. Not five per cent,
of them could either read or write. Moreover they
were under serious religious disability. Though
nominal Hindus, they had no right to enter purely
Hindu temples nor to approach in worship any
strictly Hindu deity. The most sacred of Hindu
religious books were denied them, and the most
cherished of Hindu rites and ceremonies they were
deemed totally unfit to observe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All that they could claim was permission to appease
the demons of their ancestral worship. I have
seen these outcastes, who, while absorbed into
Hinduism, nevertheless live constantly under its
ban. They erect fine halls and shrines in Brahmanical
temples, but are not permitted to enter them
after the day of their dedication to Hindu worship.
Hinduism has never declined any pecuniary
offerings from these despised ones; and yet it has
never deemed it its province or duty to impart its religious
blessings to them. It has denied to them instruction,
comfort and salvation. Is it a wonder that
most of the people were almost on a level with
brutes so far as thoughts of the highest interests of
the soul are concerned? These are the people whom
Christianity has delighted to rescue from their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thralldom and to build up in religious thought, ambition
and spiritual blessings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has applied itself to the task of raising them
from their low estate. It has erected buildings for
their instruction. In most cases its prayer-houses
have been daily used as schoolhouses where the
young have been instructed; so that today this community
stands distinguished among the other communities
in the land for its intelligence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For example, the total number of Christian youth
in mission schools in South India is 62,000—two-thirds
of them being boys and one-third girls, which
represents a percentage to the total of school-going-age
of 68.7 for boys and 33.7 for girls; and this
while, in the general community, only twelve per
cent, of those who are of an age to be at school are
attending school. Among the Brahmans only is
literacy more common than among Indian Christians.
And even that caste, which has for thirty centuries
represented the cultured aristocracy of India, must
look to its laurels; for, though their males are preëminent
in culture, the females are as illiterate as any
class in India, only six in 1,000 being able to read.
In the Christian community, on the other hand, the
women are not far behind the men in the race for
culture. It is therefore not difficult to prophesy that
the day is not far off when the Indian Christians,
among whom both sexes find equal opportunity and
inducement to study in the schools, will outstrip the
Brahmans and stand preëminent as the educated and
cultured class of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is as true in the higher as in the lower grades
of education. There are today living 418 native
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christian graduates of the Madras University. Last
year twenty-seven of these Christian youth received
the B. A. degree in that Presidency alone, and the only
three Indian ladies who have seized the difficult and
much coveted prize of Master of Arts from that University
are Christians. These facts are significant and
reveal the marvellous progress made by this once
despised community.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the character of these Christians the testimony
of Sir Alexander Mackensie, a distinguished
Anglo Indian statesman of large experience, may be
of interest:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The advance made (in missions) during
my time,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“have been substantial and
encouraging, and it is my firm belief that the day-spring
of still better things is very close at hand,
while the simple faith and godly lives of many native
Christians, might put all, or most of us certainly, to
the blush.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be well to add emphasis here to the position
of woman in the native Christian community as a
direct result of mission endeavour in that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The new womanhood of the infant native Christian
community has begun to impress itself upon the
land. There are nearly five hundred thousand
women and girls connected with the Protestant
missions of that country today. They are being
trained for, and introduced to, new spheres and opportunities
such as the women of India never dreamed
of before. Thousands of them are engaged as
teachers and as Bible women. Some practice medicine;
others adorn and cheer the homes, beautify
the lives and strengthen the work of pastors and
preachers, of teachers, doctors and other professional
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men. They grow into the full bloom of womanhood
before they leave their school training; and
they go forth well equipped intellectually, morally
and spiritually for the manifold duties of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last few years have not only helped the Christian
women of the land, as a class, they have also
brought into distinction many of them who are
worthy to stand among the eminent women of the
age and world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first of these, both on account of the remarkable
career which she has led and of the noble work
which she is performing, is the well-known Pundita
Ramabai. Herself a Brahman widow, who lost her
father in the tender years of childhood and who subsequently
entered into the joys and blessed power of
a Christian life, she dedicated herself to the work of
redeeming her unfortunate Hindu sisters from their
sad lot. To this noble work of philanthropy and of
heroic Christian service she has given herself absolutely;
and through distinguished administrative skill
and a triumphant faith she has achieved marvellous
success. Beside her well-known institution for child-widows
at Poonah—the Sharada Sadan, which the
writer visited and greatly admired—the recent famine
inspired her to a new effort to save the waifs and
orphans of that region. So that, today, she has
under her care more than two thousand of the unfortunate
ones of her own sex whom she is not only
protecting and wisely training for worthy positions
in life, but is also bringing forward into the joys of a
true Christian life. Few women, in any land, have
found a more useful, or more honourable, career than
this noble woman of the East. She combines, in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rare degree, large capacity for work, the highest
sanity in her methods and the deepest love for those
whom she has given her life to bless.

The Sorabjis, also of Western India, have achieved
distinction beyond most native Christian families.
Mr. Sorabji was one of the few Parsees who have
embraced Christianity. One of the daughters of the
family, the widow of an Englishman, lives in London
and has delighted the Queen by her exquisite rendering
of Persian songs. One sister is an artist, whose
paintings are exhibited in Paris and London. One is
a surgeon of distinction. It was another daughter of
this family who was the only representative of her sex
from the Orient at the Parliament of Religions in
Chicago. The most distinguished of these seven
sisters is Cornelia Sorabji, the barrister. Her graduating
paper on <span class="tei tei-q">“Roman Law,”</span> at Oxford, was
classed among the best papers produced by the
pupils of that famous institution. She is the first
lady barrister of India, and is not only a powerful
advocate, but also a brilliant writer, as her book and
her articles on the woman question in <span class="tei tei-q">“The Nineteenth
Century”</span> amply testify.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Toru Dutt, of Calcutta, one of the brilliant young
stars of India, was versed in French, German and English.
At twenty-one she published <span class="tei tei-q">“A Sheaf Gleaned
in French Fields.”</span> It is a skillful and able English
translation of the works of famous French authors.
She and her sister, Aru, were remarkably talented.
It is sad that she, who was so full of intellectual
brightness and so beautiful in Christian life, should
have been taken away by death in the bloom of life.

The second Mrs. Sattianathan, herself an M. A. of
the Madras University, has entered upon a brilliant
career as a writer, and has established the first English
monthly magazine for her Indian sisters—a magazine
which is full of attractiveness and promise.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These ladies are only a few of those who illustrate
the ability, devotion, beauty and promise of the
women of India. Such are preëminently the hope of
that country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was while looking upon one of these Indian
Christian ladies that the late Benjamin Harrison, Ex-President
of the United States, remarked that if he
had spent a million dollars for missions and had seen,
as a result of his offering, only one such convert as
Miss Singh he would still have considered his offering
a most profitable investment.

These women are creating their own opportunities
and will, ere long, achieve much in all the ranks of
life and especially in their own peculiar sphere of
womanly activity and influence. Woman will do
more for the progress and development of the
country than the sterner sex, as she has hitherto done
more than he to conserve and dignify the past. And
it is safe to conclude that the womanhood of India
will discover its chief glory as it now finds its
largest opportunity in Christianity. And I may add
that the mission of Christianity to, and in behalf of,
the women of that land may almost be called its
chief mission, as the results which it has achieved,
and will yet achieve, in this line, will constitute its
chief glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At large centres the Indian Christian community is
already beginning to feel its power and is organizing
in behalf of its own highest interest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Madras Native Christian Association”</span> is perhaps
the strongest organization of the community.
It unites hundreds of the best members and gives
them a corporate existence and furnishes opportunity
to render articulate the ideals, ambitions and needs of
the Christian community. It has recently undertaken
several enterprises of importance, such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Twentieth Century Enterprise and the Indian Christian
Industrial Exhibition</span></span>. It discusses, with much sanity,
the most serious problems of the community and
creates a worthy sentiment which will increasingly
spread until it reaches the remotest parts of the country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this tends to show that the community is growing
conscious both of its strength, its responsibility
and its opportunity.

For the furtherance of this purpose weekly and
monthly magazines, both in the English language
and in the vernaculars, are being conducted by them.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Christian Patriot</span></span>, the best organ of the community,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seriousness with which all the native Christians
of India regard their calling and the gratitude
with which they enjoy their faith is clearly attested
by their offerings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps nothing can render more satisfactory reply
to those who charge the native Christians with
worldly motives than to show how far they deny
themselves in behalf of their faith. In other words
the benevolence and offerings of the native Christians
may be taken as a fair test of their sincerity
and of their spiritual appreciation. It is a good test in
any land. I have said that they are very poor. A few
years ago I investigated carefully the economic conditions
of the most prosperous and largest village congregation
of the Madura Mission. I discovered that
five rupees (that is $1.66) was the average monthly income
of each family of that congregation. And that
meant only thirty-three cents a month for the support
of each member of a family! We have congregations
whose income is less than this. And yet, the
Christians of that mission contributed over two rupees
(seventy-five cents) per church member as their offering
for 1900. For all the Protestant Missions of South
India the average offering per church member during
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1900 was one rupee and nine annas (fifty-two cents).
For South India this represented an aggregate sum of
R 248,852 ($85,000) or about seven and one-half per
cent, of the total sum expended in the missions during
that year. An American can easily realize how much
this offering is as an absolute gift; but he cannot realize
how much of self-denial it means to that very
poor people; nor how large an offering it is as related
to the best offerings of our home churches today.
If our American Christians contributed for the
cause of Christ a percentage of their income equal to
that of the native Christians of India they would quadruple
their benevolence. And if, in relation to their
income, the Christians of India contribute four times
as much as the Christians of America, in relation to
their real ability, after supplying the most primitive
needs of their bodies, they contribute a hundred times
more than do their brothers and sisters in this great
land of luxury and abundance. Who in America, today,
in contributing to the cause of Christ, denies
himself a convenience or a comfort; yea more, who
on that account fails to meet the craving of bodily
appetite? And yet there are many Christians in India
who suffer in both these respects in order that they
may add the widow's mite to the treasury of the
Church and their loving offering to advance the Kingdom
of the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this way the infant Christian Church of India, in
its poverty of this world's goods, is revealing a wealth
of spirit and a richness of purpose such as are worthy
of emulation in Christian lands today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The organized effort of the Indian Church for self-extension
is rapidly multiplying. Every endeavour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is put forth to train them out of that spirit of dependence
which is one of the necessary evils incident to
modern missions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In nearly all well organized missions in India are
found, as we have already seen, Home Missionary
Societies, which are conducted and maintained by the
people, and which constantly direct their thoughts to
their privilege to further the cause of Christ in their
own land and among their own people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Work by the young for the young, also, is being
conducted with increasing prevalence, zeal and success
throughout the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, all departments of a healthful, normal life
and activity are vigorously prosecuted on mission territory
with a view to imparting to the Christians, not
only a knowledge of the highest type of Christian
altruism, but also for the purpose of making them
partakers of the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the Indian Christian community at present,
notwithstanding all its faults and weaknesses, which
I would not conceal, furnishes us much encouragement
as a product of past effort and as a growing
power which is to be used by God in the speedy upbuilding
of his Kingdom in that great land of the
East.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, indeed, not many forms of organized
Christian activity conducted by Indian Christians
themselves—apart from Western missions. There
are some, however, which are worthy of note and
commendation. Such are Pandita Ramabai's Mukti
Mission for Widows; Miss Chuckerbutty's flourishing
Orphanages; Mrs. Sorabji's High School for
Women; the Gopalgange Mission started by the Rev.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
M. N. Bose, and Dr. P. B. Keskar's Orphanage and
Industrial School at Sholapur.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Recently a novel enterprise was inaugurated in the
American Mission, Jaffna, Ceylon, in the form of a
Foreign Missionary Society, which sends forth, to a
region in Southern India, its missionaries to carry the
gospel of Christ to the non-Christians of that place.
It is chiefly conducted and supported by the young
people of the mission and is prophetic of a movement
which will, ere long, spring up throughout India as
a result of a growing sense of responsibility and opportunity
among the Christians of that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is with no spirit of boasting that I wish to dwell
upon the share which America has had in producing
these results. Other people have done in some respects,
better than we. But there is no doubt that
India is much influenced by our land. America has,
for a century, lavishly given her sons and daughters
and expended her wealth for the salvation of India.
Her sacrifices have not been in vain. None have
found more hearty response among that people than
the American Missions. Among the many Protestant
Missions now at work in that Peninsula less than one-fourth
are American; and, yet in connection with
these missions have been gathered and are found
nearly one-half of all of the Protestant Christians of
that land. In South India the mission which has
found much the largest success in gathering converts
is an American Mission. In North India, again, one
of our missions stands preëminent in the multitude
of its Christians, and another, in the excellence of its
educational power and leavening influence. In Western
India, also, America stands first in the acknowledged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
power and preëminence of one of its missions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the organized movements for the young, America
again stands conspicuous in that land. As we
study the wonderful activity exercised by Protestant
Christianity in behalf of India's youth, we are at once
impressed by the leadership of American workers as
we are by the American methods used.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The finest Y. M. C. A. building in the Orient is
mostly American, both in conception and in the organized
energy and princely offering which made it
possible. It stands today in the city of Madras, as
one of the noblest and the most beautiful tributes of
western Christian enterprise to that great land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only theological seminary which has been
adequately endowed for the training of Protestant
Christian workers in India, is an American one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the best, because the most sane and enterprising,
Christian weekly newspaper in the land is
American.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only Quarterly Review conducted in that land
by Protestant Christians was founded by an American.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, in the same line, it is interesting to note that
American presses and publishing houses are multiplying
and are exercising an ever-widening influence
in the redemption of that country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So largely have all these American agencies been
used for the furtherance of Christian truth and light;
and so much have they been welcomed and appropriated
by the people, that it may well be spoken of
as <span class="tei tei-q">“an American Invasion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bishop of Newcastle, England, referred to this
in his last annual sermon. <span class="tei tei-q">“So far,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
America realized the need of winning India to Christ
that a hundred years hence, if the last thirty years'
proportion continue, India will owe its Christianity
more to America than to Great Britain and Ireland
combined.”</span> These words are no less significant in
their truthfulness than generous in their appreciation.
England has been entrusted with the work of leading
that great people of the Orient, politically and socially,
into a larger and higher life. This, by a strange
Providence, has been entrusted to her in consequence
of her conquest of that people seven thousand miles
away and seven times her own population. So also
has America been favoured with a fair share of opportunity
and of influence as the moral supporter of
England in this unique and unprecedented work.
And, while England by the nature of her compact,
or conquest, is somewhat handicapped in this task,
so far as her religious influence upon the people is
concerned, America has free access and ample
entrance into the heart of the community because of
her disinterested and unrestrained relationship to
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her voice to India has always been the voice of a
constraining altruism. All her endeavours in that land
have been the outgoings of a world-wide philanthropy
and of Christian self-denial. Therefore, she
has been free and unencumbered in all her ambitions
for the uplifting of that people; and she has
found the heartiest response and warmest appreciation
from those whom she has sought to bless.
Consequently, that noble band of 1,000 of her sons
and daughters, who are today giving themselves to
the salvation of India; and the one million dollars
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sent forth annually to maintain her work in that land,
are fruitful in the highest good and in the richest result
in all parts of the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While all this means a great achievement, it
means also, and preëminently, a stirring opportunity.
The widest door of opportunity is open to
America among her antipodes in that historic land.
Christian effort can nowhere else find heartier welcome
or results more encouraging and telling in the
great gathering of eastern nations into the Kingdom
of our Lord.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our Lord compared his Kingdom to the
mustard seed which grew into a tree. This
wonderful growth and development of his
Kingdom we considered in the last chapter. He compared
it also to the leaven which was placed in the
meal and which leavened the whole lump. We shall
now consider the leavening or assimilating work of
his Kingdom as at present witnessed in India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If a man were to ask me, <span class="tei tei-q">“wherein do you find
the most encouragement as a Christian worker in
India?”</span> I would doubtless reply:—not in the
Church and community gathered by the missions,
but outside of the Christian fold, in the institutions,
and among the non-Christians, of the land. It is not
in the fields already harvested (though much of joy
and promise we certainly find there), but in the fields
whitening for the harvest, that we see the largest
hope for the ultimate conquest of that great people
by Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are in India, at present, a thousand results,
movements and tendencies which, to the thoughtful,
watchful, Christian worker, bespeak the rapid coming
of the Kingdom of Christ, even though their
testimony is not heard through mission statistical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tables, and though their activity is found mostly outside
the visible pale of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I appreciate the fact that, when we begin to consider
these results which lie outside the life and
organization of the Christian community, we need
much discernment and discrimination, lest we ascribe
to Christianity alone an influence and an efficiency
which it only shares with Western thought and
civilization. But it is not only impossible to separate
these forces, in our endeavour to estimate the share of
each in the results achieved; western thought and
civilization, both in their origin and development, are
themselves as much the product as they are the expression
of Christianity; so that we need not hesitate
much in ascribing to our faith all the results which
the combined energy of these have produced in that
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another discrimination is here necessary. In the
last chapter we dwelt, almost exclusively, upon
Protestant missionary activity and results. These
we were able to measure chiefly through the concentrated
activity and published statistical reports of
Protestant Missions. But, in considering the more
indirect and general results there achieved we must
not forget that they must be ascribed to all the
Christian agencies at work in that land. I believe
that Protestant Christianity is much the largest Christian
power among all the forces that make for the
redemption of India. And yet it would be presumptuous
and unjust not to recognize the strenuous
activity and pervasive influence of Roman Catholicism
in the land. I am convinced that that great historic
Church, with all its errors and false methods, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nevertheless a positive and a mighty power in the
dissemination of Christian thought and principles in
India. In the results which I am about to mention,
this and all other Christian agencies have had their
share.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of these activities, indeed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seem</span></em> to come directly
from none of the organized agencies of Christianity
in the land. But they are only apparently so.
They are among the thousand subtle influences which
work in a quiet way in the minds and life of the
people and which suddenly, from time to time, break
upon our sight through their results. An illustration
of this kind occurred not long ago. It is said that
one of the vernacular versions of the Gospels accidentally
fell into the hands of a Mohammedan
Moulvi, or teacher, in North India. It had been prepared
and published by the Bible Society. The Mussulman
read the book with eagerness, chiefly with a
view to find new arguments against the divinity of
our Lord and the heavenly source of our faith. But,
as he read, he was so impressed with the wonderful
narrative and the unique beauty of the character of
our Lord, that he surrendered himself to him as his
Saviour and found in him peace and rest. Sometime
later he met a Hindu fakir, named Chet Ram,
who was earnestly in search of the truth. The Mohammedan
convert joyfully told him of his newly
found Saviour and gave him his copy of the New
Testament that he might find for himself the same
blessing. The Holy Spirit carried the Gospel message
of life into his heart also, and he accepted Christ
and at once began to preach him unto his friends and
neighbours. This work he performed faithfully; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he gathered around himself many who accepted his
following, short creed;—<span class="tei tei-q">“I believe in Jesus Christ
the Son of Mary and in the Holy Ghost and in the
Father to whom prayer should be made and in the
Bible through which salvation is to be received.”</span>
Chet Ram died some time ago; but there are today
found, scattered through the villages of North India,
thousands of his followers who subscribed to his
brief creed and who always carry upon their persons
a copy of the Scriptures. So far as I know, these
people have never come into contact with Christian
workers, but have been led simply through a study
of God's Word, under the guidance of God's Spirit,
unto Christ the Saviour of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is one of the most encouraging facts connected
with Christian influence in India that one so often
and unexpectedly meets its manifestations in individual
life and institutions. Suddenly he comes across
little streams of influence whose source may be unknown,
but which do a great deal towards fertilizing
thought and producing a harvest of religious results
throughout the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The general subject of the influence of the West
upon the East has been recently raised in the very interesting
and thought-provoking book on <span class="tei tei-q">“Asia and
Europe”</span> by the English writer, Meredith Townsend.
He stiffly maintains that the West never has, and,
probably, never will, seriously and permanently influence
the East in thought and life. While there is
a semblance, yea an element, of truth in his contention,
so far as the past is concerned, it fails to apply
to the India of the present and must fall far wide of
the mark in the future. Many years have elapsed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
since the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Asia and Europe”</span> left India;
and he is not conversant, at first hand, with the
mighty revolution which is taking place there at present.
He fails, for one thing, to appreciate the wonderful
influence of modern scientific discovery as a
unifier of all peoples and as the handmaid of western
life and thought and of Christian conquest. I need
refer only to one of these modern agencies—the
telegraph. The election of Mr. McKinley as president
of the United States was known to me in India
before it was known to nine-tenths of the population
of this land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The calamity which recently befell Galveston,
Texas, was not only known to Hindus, the very next
day; the price of cotton went up in South India villages
as a consequence of that sad event. The generous
offerings recently contributed in America for
the famine sufferers in India were actually distributed
to them in food the next day after they were offered!
Can these things, and a thousand like them, which
enter into the every-day transactions of East and
West, have no permanent influence upon the relations
of these once remote but now neighbouring
people? Isolation has everywhere given way to intercourse
and mutual dependence; and that means
community of life and thought which produces
fundamental action and reaction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under these new and marvellous conditions the
former <span class="tei tei-q">“mental seclusion of India,”</span> so unduly emphasized
by Mr. Townsend, is rapidly yielding and
must utterly pass away. It will, however, not pass
away simply because of the influence of the West
upon the East, but rather because of the mutual action
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and reaction of East and West. The East will
approach the West because, to a large extent, the
West will have learned to appreciate, and to draw in
sympathy towards, the East. Herein lies the secret
of the future oneness, or at least of the communion,
of the two great hemispheres.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
India is, therefore, in this matter, facing today such
conditions as never before existed there; and these
are to further considerably the work of revolution
which our religion is bringing to pass in that land,
and which such pessimists as Mr. Townsend are
wont to ignore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That keen philosopher and high authority upon
India, Sir Alfred Lyall, is right in his anticipation
when he claims that India <span class="tei tei-q">“will be carried swiftly
through phases which have occupied long stages in
the lifetime of other nations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considering, then, the leavening influences and the
general results of our faith in that land we shall see
them in many institutions and departments of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) In laws which the government of India has
enacted during the last century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There has been a steady conflict between the enlightened
government of the white man and the
inhuman customs of the people of that land. The
Christian sentiment of the members of the government,
and of other Christians outside of that circle,
has ever rebelled against and sought to put down the
grossest evils which obtain there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the fact which we need to emphasize here is
that these evils have been directed and protected by
Hinduism itself and are an integral part of its ceremonies
and teachings. Whenever the government
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has sought, by legislation, to do away with these
inhuman rites and customs it has been bitterly opposed
by Hinduism and has been met by a general
uprising of its followers against what they have
called religious interference and persecution. Thus
the suppression of Thuggism was a definite attack
upon a religious institution, for the Thuggs never
committed a murder, save as a part of their worship
of the goddess Bhowanee to whose service they had
dedicated themselves and to which the blood of the innocent
traveller (as they thought) was the most welcome
sacrifice its devotee could offer. Hence the
difficulty which faced the government in bringing
these religious murders to an end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suttee was also regarded as a high type of religious
devotion. For the widow to immolate herself upon
the funeral pyre of her dead husband was not only
the supreme test of wifely devotion, it was also preëminently
the highest religious act possible to her;
and it brought to her a future bliss which was painted
in glowing and attractive colours by the sacred books
of her faith. It was not strange, therefore, that the
State hesitated, for a long time, to abolish by law this
hideous custom, whereby in the year 1817, for instance,
two widows were burned daily in the Bengal
Presidency alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was in the face of extensive protest and threats
by orthodox Hindus that the government abolished
it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Previous to 1857, 150 human sacrifices are said
to have been annually offered in Gumsur, a city in
East Central India; and the abolition of that horrible
custom raised such a storm of opposition among the
Hindus that an eight years' war was the result. More
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than 2,000 victims were rescued from sacrifice and
handed over to the care of the missionaries.”</span> In like
manner infanticide was encouraged for centuries in
the land as an act of religious devotion which was
possessed of great efficacy. In the name of religion
and with the promise of its highest blessings mothers
were led to feed the crocodiles of the sacred Ganges
by throwing to them their own infants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems hardly possible that human beings could
regard the prohibition of that inhuman and unnatural
act as a piece of injustice and an interference with
the rights of conscience. And yet it was so regarded!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not fewer than twenty laws have thus been enacted
in that land, during the last century, with a
view to putting an end to religious customs which
robbed thousands of people, annually, of life itself
and deprived many thousands more of the most elementary
and inalienable rights of human beings. So
it has become penal to do any one of the following
things, all of which were regarded as expressions of
the highest religious devotion and were committed
with the sanction of the ancestral faith and under the
inspiration of its benediction: to burn widows; to
expose parents to death on the banks of the Ganges;
to offer up human sacrifice; to murder children,
either by throwing them into the Ganges, or by the
Rajpoot secret method of infanticide; to encourage
men to throw away their lives under temple cars
and in other ways of religious devotion; to encourage
various forms of voluntary self-torture and self-mutilation;
to outrage girls under a certain age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How much hath the Spirit of Christ wrought in
that land during the century by saving the lives of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
millions of poor innocent creatures from the ravages
of a savage faith and an inhuman religious devotion!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, in India today the laws protect the people,
old and young, from the old murderous customs of
its religion, and gives a sanctity to life and a protection
to the innocent and a check to the mad, suicidal
tendency of the religious fanatic, such as India never
before knew. And all this has been done in the
teeth of their religion and notwithstanding the persistent
cries and protests of the religious leaders of
the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have already mentioned the fact that the obscene
and the impure have in many ways been fostered by
that faith, and that the government has thus far been
unable to find courage to apply to religious temples,
symbols and rites that legislation which it has enacted
against the obscene in literature and in the ordinary
life of the people. And yet, we are encouraged to
find there this anomaly today,—that men, for translating
and publishing obscene portions of the Hindu
scriptures, have been punished in accordance with
this law. The day will, doubtless, soon come, it
must come, when this legislation against obscenity
will be enforced without exception in favour of temple
cars and sacred objects and rites.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In reference to caste observance the State has been
more courageous and has absolutely ignored class
distinction among its subjects. No one who has not
lived in the East can realize how radical and important
this policy is in that land of class distinctions
based upon religious injunction and revelation. It
seemed absurd and unrighteous to that people that
the august and sacred Brahman and the unclean and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
outcaste Pariah should be regarded as equal before
the law, and that a pauper should enjoy, with a
prince, the same protection and blessings from the
State. Regardless of immemorial custom and religious
injunction, the government has become the great
leveller—it has ignored entirely, in all the rights and
privileges which it has to confer, every caste distinction
and class privilege and disability which Hinduism
had created and sacredly maintained for centuries.
And it adheres stiffly to its Christian principle of the
equal rights of all its subjects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Moreover, Hinduism itself is being gradually
transformed under the search-light of a present
Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only has it been compelled, from without, to
give up some of its inhuman practices, it has also
voluntarily, from very shame, relinquished some of
its grossest evils.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a very interesting conflict now going on
in Hinduism—between the ultra-conservatives and
the progressives. This latter class is composed almost
entirely of men who have been educated in
mission and government schools, and who have been
influenced by Christian light and life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not expect much from a Christianized Hinduism
any more than I do from a Hinduized Christianity.
And yet we cannot be unmindful of, nor ungrateful
for, that growing sense of shame which leads that
faith to conceal, if not to abandon entirely, some of
its worst crimes against man and to adorn itself in
such a way that it may not too violently shock the
sensibilities of a people who are living under the
growing light of a Christian civilization.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is what the ancestral faith of India is now intent
upon doing, at least so far as the changing situation
compels. The influence of educated Hindus
upon the pundits and other religious guides of the
land is increasing annually, and is steadily in favour of
religious reform and of a broad and enlightened interpretation
of Shastraic deliverances upon religious
customs. For example, a few years ago, sea voyages
were strictly prohibited to all Hindus. No exceptions
were allowed and excommunication was the inevitable
penalty for the violation of this religious injunction.
Today hundreds of Hindus, impelled by an
ambition for the best education and for a broad
culture, annually travel to England and to other
foreign lands. Though some of those men are punished
for their temerity in defying this sacred injunction
of their faith, it is remarkable how many
pundits arise to defend such travel and to reduce
the opprobrium which overtakes a sea-travelled
man. Indeed, every year adds to the ease with
which such a man can avoid punishment for going
abroad.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Until recently, Hinduism had no way of reinstating
a man who had deserted his ancestral faith and had
thereby broken caste. Today this subject is up for
discussion, and many of the religious leaders are
pointing to passages from their Scriptures which justify
such a reinstatement and are showing methods
by which it can be effected. In consequence of this
not a few back-sliding Christians have recently found
an open door to reenter their ancestral faith. This is
an important move; but I doubt whether it will cause
Christians to lose any converts save those who are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not sincere and who would therefore be better outside
than within the Christian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A generation ago few Hindus in the villages of the
land would fail to defend polytheism and idolatry as
an essential part of their faith. At present the Christian
preacher, as he travels among these same people,
finds universal assent to his declaration concerning
the unity of God. I have hardly met one villager in
the land who maintains today that there are really
<span class="tei tei-q">“gods many.”</span> Polytheism is not defended but explained
away, and idolatry, it is claimed, is only an
accommodation—a kind of religious kindergarten—for
the sake of the very ignorant, and <span class="tei tei-q">“for women
and children.”</span> But of course, pantheism is the Hindu's
conception of the divine unity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whenever an educated Hindu defends his faith, in
an argument with a Christian, he never quotes as
scriptural authority the more recent writings of their
faith—the Tantras and Puranas, which are the storehouse
of legend and myth, of myriad rites and customs
and are the refuge and joy of the orthodox and
conservative pandits;—he discards these and falls
back upon the most ancient writings, which are the
exponents of nature worship and of vedantic philosophy.
Or he will extol the Bhagavat Gita, which is
an eclectic attempt to unify and approve the conflicting
philosophies of Brahmanism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these, and in many other ways, Hinduism finds
today new presentation and defence. It is not the
thing it used to be. And yet in matters of fundamental
importance it is and will remain unchanged.
In some respects these changes make that ancient
faith less vulnerable to attack. In the words of Doctor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Robson,—<span class="tei tei-q">“The influence of Christianity upon
Hinduism has been rather to strengthen its rival by
forcing it to abandon certain positions which weakened
it, and bringing it more into accordance with
natural religion. But Hinduism remains the same.
The contest is coming to be between the ultimate
principles of the two religions, and these are
irreconcilable.”</span><a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
Yes, it will be a good day for Christianity
when the great contest is thus narrowed down, and
when the deepest teachings of the two faiths will be
placed in clear and simple juxtaposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One serious source of danger in this controversy
lies in the Neo-Hinduism which interprets Hinduism
in the light of Christian truth and modern thought.
Hindus formerly maintained that the teachings of
Christianity were false. Now they tell us that most
of its truths were taught by their own faith even before
the Christian era! Through the allegories of
their Shastras, and under the guidance of the fertile
imagination of that Englishwoman, Mrs. Besant, they
find equally the best Christian truth and most recent
results of modern scientific discovery taught by their
ancient scriptures! Mrs. Besant has even discovered
that the ten incarnations of Vishnu are based on strict
evolution principles and follow that order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She claims, indeed, that many of the most recent
discoveries in the physical universe were anticipated
and promulgated three millenniums ago by Hindu
rishis. This of course is a method of insanity which
will soon give way to a newer craze. For the present
it helps to evade or confuse the issue in certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
minds; but as it is in itself a substitution of nonsense
for argument and reason it will not long deceive any
one, not even the poor Hindu.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And just as, under the present Christian régime,
Hinduism is rapidly being transformed, no less truly
does the Mohammedan faith undergo change. There
is a new Islam arising in India. That faith cannot be
preserved in its rigid integrity under the ægis of a
Christian government; therefore in India the faith of
the great Arabian prophet has undergone marked
transformation during the last century and a half. Its
religious leaders there are rationalists who scrutinize
and criticise the Koran with the boldness of the
higher critics of the Bible. They both urge that the
Koran has no permanent authority on moral questions,
and also insist upon progress in all religious
matters.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This young Mohammedan party of progress have
found a vigorous leader in Judge Amir Ali Sahib, a
brilliant writer, who hesitates not to explain away
or antagonize all those teachings of his faith
which lie athwart the path of progress and enlightenment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He avows, in his book on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit of Islam,”</span>
that his purpose is to assist <span class="tei tei-q">“the Muslims of India to
achieve intellectual and moral regeneration under the
auspices of the Great European Power that now holds
their destiny in its hands.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The reformers,”</span> he
further writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“are congratulated that the movement
set on foot is conducted under a neutral government.”</span>
Thus a Mussulman writer declares that the highest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reforms can best be conducted under a Christian
government!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is illustrative of that leavening influence of
our faith as it comes into contact with and permeates
the spirit and teaching of these and other religions of
that land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Another marked result of Christianity in that
country is seen in the attitude of many thousands of
Hindus who live contiguous to the Christian communities
found there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first place we see it among the common people.
I have already referred to mass movements
which have largely helped to strengthen the Christian
Church in the past. Those movements have only
just begun; they will continue and increase in the
land. Day by day Christianity is commending itself
to the people in a thousand ways. In times of famine,
when the old religious leaders of the people—the
Brahmans—render no help and manifest no sympathy,
yea more, are as rapacious as ever, the loving sympathy
of Christians there and in far off lands, and
their outgoing charity and their substantial help to the
famine stricken and the suffering—all this does not
fall in vain upon the susceptible mind of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This work of Christianity in uniting the world
through brotherhood and sympathy seems wonderful
to a people who are crushed and robbed by the
wretched divisiveness of their own terrible caste system.
They recognize also the truth and the life
which Christianity presents in contrast with the debasing
idolatry and the senseless, all-pervasive ceremonialism
which haunt them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not surprising therefore that we see, not only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain mass movements towards our faith but also, on
the outskirts of the Christian community in every district,
a growing number of doubting, halting ones—those
who have done with their ancestral faith and
who are attracted by the religion of Christ, but who
are so much afraid of the terrible demon, caste, that
they dare not openly accept Christ and unite with
God's people through baptism. They linger on the
outside, hoping for some great tide of influence to
come, soon, to carry them, without persecution, into
the kingdom. Their attitude of mind is encouraging,
and the missionary hopes for the day which will furnish
the strength and opportunity for this great host
of weak and doubting ones to make its decision for
Christ and to enter, in ever-increasing numbers, into
His Kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have come into daily, close touch with many men
and women of this class. They, at the same time,
encourage and exasperate one. They give evidence
of the strong influence of our faith upon them—they
have ceased to visit Hindu temples, they decline to
worship the family and tribal gods, they lose no opportunity
to denounce the idolatry and superstitions
which have debased them, and they always speak to
their friends a warm word for Christianity and often
attend its meetings in their village. But there they
continue to stand. They are the slaves of caste fear
and of social inertia. While, however, they stand
and wait they often say the word and give the encouragement
which enable others to accept Christ
openly and to enter the Christian fold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are also always glad to send their children to
our schools and are willing to have them instructed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the truth and guided into the life of our faith.
They often contribute towards the support of Christian
pastor or teacher, and in various other ways
evince their sympathy and reveal their intellectual
assent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For instance:—In Tinnevelly there is a hall built by
such a Hindu to commemorate the late Queen Victoria,
in which lectures and entertainments are held.
Christian ministers are frequently asked to pray at
these gatherings; and former years have witnessed
requests by the donor for prayer, from well-known
ministers and bishops. Such appreciation of Christian
worship is very pleasing, particularly as the
proprietor is a member of a committee that has the
oversight of nearly 300 Sivite temples in the district.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They also show their appreciation of the medical
work of Christian missions. In the city of Madura
stands one of the finest hospitals in the country. It
is the property of the American Board, but was
erected, at an expense of $14,000 by members of the
orthodox Hindu community as a monument of their
appreciation of the mission physician and of their
confidence in the mission and its work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Another marked feature of the religious life
of India, at present, is the existence there of several
new cults or religions. They not only add picturesqueness
to the religious situation, they also reveal
the unrest of the people and their desire for something
better than the orthodox faith of their fathers
furnishes them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having become dissatisfied and disgusted with
their ancestral religion, they are striving in every possible
way, short of being Christians, to seek for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
something better and higher. This is what we
should expect. In the many schools and colleges of
the land the subtle metaphysics of the East is supplanted
by the modern philosophy of the West;
their own bewildering ancient rules of logic are replaced
by the more rational processes of the West.
So that every university matriculate and graduate of
India is today crammed with ideas, and trained in
methods of thinking, which make a belief in practical
Hinduism and in much of its philosophy an impossibility,
if not an absurdity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus we see in that land today a number of movements
and organizations which are a protest against
orthodox Hinduism and are carrying the people, in
thought and sympathy, from the past to the present,
from the old to the new. Most of these movements
are merely half-way houses between Hinduism and
Christianity. They are with faces more or less turned
towards the light and possess the progressive spirit
which, in some cases, cannot fail of landing their
members, at no distant date in the Christian fold.
For instance, we have in western India the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prartanei
Somaj</span></span> (prayer society); in north India the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arya Somaj</span></span>
(Aryan society), and in Bengal the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brahmo Somaj</span></span>
(society of God).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are healthy movements, away from a general,
old-fashioned view of religious things. Take,
for example, the Brahmo Somaj. Though not as
large in membership as the Arya Somaj it represents
more culture and power. Nearly all the members
are men of education and of western training, and
represent much more influence than their number
(4,000) would suggest. Their new faith is an eclecticism.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It has adopted a little of Hinduism and of
Buddhism and of Mohammedanism and a great deal
of Christianity. The movement, especially that progressive
branch which was under the leadership of
Protab Chunder Mozumdar, is largely Christian in
drift and spirit. Mozumdar accepts Christ, though
not in the fullness of belief in His divinity or in His
atoning work; nevertheless with an amount of appreciation,
affection, devotion and loyalty not met
even among many Western Christians today. His
book on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Oriental Christ”</span> is full of appreciation
and reveals a wonderful knowledge of the eastern
Christ from an Eastern standpoint. I shall not be
surprised to see the members of this society landing,
at an early date, through a full confession of Christ,
in membership of the Christian Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meanwhile it is disappointing to find this
organization divided, already, into so many mutually
antagonistic sects. It is also a reason for regret that
Mozumdar, who is a man of great culture, intelligence
and deep spiritually, has recently relinquished
the leadership of the movement. Having retired to
the Himalayas, he communicates his reasons in these
truly oriental, pathetic and pessimistic words:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Age and sickness get the better of me in these
surroundings, I cannot work as I would—contemplation
is distracted, concentration disturbed, though I
struggle ever so much. These solitudes are hospitable;
these breadths, heights and depths are always
suggestive. I acquire more spirit with less struggle,
hence I retire.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My thirst for the higher life is growing so unquenchable
that I need the time and the grace to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reëxamine and purify and reform every part of my
existence. The Spirit of God promises me that grace
if I am alone. So let me alone.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The rich are so vain and selfish, the poor are so
insolent and mean, that having respect for both I
prefer to go away from them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The learned think so highly of themselves, the
ignorant are so full of hatred and uncharitableness,
that having good will for both I prefer to hide myself
from all.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The religious are so exclusive, the sceptical so self-sufficient
that it is better to be away from both.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Where are the dead? Have not they too retired?
I wish my acquaintance with the dead should grow,
that my communion with them should be spontaneous,
perpetual, unceasing. I will invoke them
and wait for them in my hermitage.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is life? Is it not a fleeting shadow, the
graveyard of dead hopes, the battlefield of ghastly
competitions, the playground of delusions, separations,
cruel changes and disappointments? I have
had enough of these. And now with the kindliest
love for all, I must prepare and sanctify myself for
the great Beyond, where there is solution for so
many problems, and consolation for so many
troubles....”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This seems an unworthy ending to a very worthy
life. And yet a movement which has created two
such men as Chunder Sen and Protab Mozumdar is a
compliment to Christianity and has a mission before
it. But it must undergo many changes ere it can exercise
a commanding influence in the land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A much more popular movement is the Arya
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Somaj. The recent census reports 40,000 members
of this organization. If Brahmo Somaj represents the
working of that Hindu mind which has been imbued
with European culture and Christian thought towards
a solution of its religious doubts and problems; the
Arya Somaj represents a strong Theistic movement
springing forth out of Hinduism itself. This latter
movement is possessed of unwonted vigour and has
a future before it. The founder of this Somaj was
Dyanand Sarasvati, a Brahman who was born about
the year 1825. He was a man of much thought and
of deep religious interest. He was entirely ignorant
of the English language. He broke with orthodox
Hinduism after reading the Christian Scriptures.
And yet he also attacked the character of Jesus. He
accepted the Hindu Vedas as Scriptures, but interpreted
them so freely that he was able to find in
them all that he desired of religious reform. He
vigorously opposed caste.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following are some of the principles of the
Arya Somaj:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. God is the primary source of all true knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. God is perfect in all His attributes and should
be worshipped.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Vedas are the books of true knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The caste system is a human invention and is
evil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Early marriage is prohibited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The movement has assumed the aspect of a sect of
Hinduism. But some of its fundamental contentions
are so directly antagonistic to most cherished institutions
of Hinduism that it is a mighty disintegrator of
that religion in the land.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be confessed that the Arya Somaj is, in its
present spirit, anti-Christian. It champions the cause
of home religion in the East as against the aggression
of the great rival, Christianity. But the teachers of
our faith in India find encouragement equally in the
hostility of this movement and in its coöperation in a
common attack upon modern Hinduism. Any movement,
that effectively calls the attention of the people
to the weakness and defects of its ancestral religion,
cannot fail, in that very process, to invite their attention
to the claims of its rival, Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief function of all these movements is to
reveal the general religious interest of the people.
Indeed, they forward greatly the spirit of discontent
towards the ancestral faith. And while they do this,
they themselves furnish a no more satisfying or soul-inspiring
substitute. And in this way they emphasize
the need of a new faith and draw the thought of
many to the new supplanting religion of the Christ.
Chunder Sen, even twenty years ago, declared that,
<span class="tei tei-q">“None but Jesus, none but Jesus, none but Jesus is
worthy to wear this diadem, India, and He shall
have it.”</span> Yes, even through such movements as
the Brahmo Somaj, Christ is winning India for himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The educated classes of India are largely permeated
and influenced by Western thought. They may not
be inclined to join any of the reform movements
which I have mentioned; but they are now thinking
on absolutely different lines from those of their ancestors
fifty years ago. The dissemination of Western
literature, and especially the conduct of so many
Christian schools have done more, perhaps, than any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other thing to create an intellectual ferment and to
produce a revolution of thought in all parts of the
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One cannot unduly emphasize the importance of
Christian schools in India. The government schools
and the Hindu institutions of learning are acknowledged
to be the hot-beds of rationalism and of unbelief.
They not only furnish no religious instruction to the
youth, they too often give the impression that all religion
is a mere superstition and is unworthy of being
taught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To such an extent is this trend and influence observable
that the government experiences much concern,
coupled with an expressed, though vague,
desire, that this evil be arrested by the introduction,
into all public schools, of some method of imparting
at least the fundamental principles of religion. But
to discover the method of accomplishing this, without
violating the principle of religious neutrality,
seems beyond its power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meanwhile mission schools have a grand
sphere opened to them on this line. They are not
only a common agency, with governmental and all
other higher institutions, in the work of undermining
and destroying vain credulity and the whole brood of
superstitions which are legion in India; they are also
a positive and constructive force in the impartation of
those principles of morality and teachings of religion
which will ennoble life here and hereafter. And in
this connection it should not be forgotten that all
mission schools—higher and lower—enjoy unlimited
opportunity to teach, daily, to all their students God's
Word and to apply its principles and its saving message
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the minds of the half million students who
are being trained by them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I desire to emphasize again the importance of all
these schools as the most potent agency, apart from
the native Church itself, in the transformation of the
thought and life of India. It is a noteworthy fact
that the only statue erected to a missionary in India
was that recently unveiled by the Governor of Madras
in the city of Madras to Dr. Wm. Miller. This noble
missionary educator has wrought mightily, through
his great institution in Madras, for the upbuilding of
Christian truth in the minds of Christian and non-Christian
youth alike. And this statue is a unique
tribute of gratitude from his <span class="tei tei-q">“old boys”</span>—most of
them still Hindus, indeed—to the man who has been
instrumental in opening before them the broad vistas
of Western thought and of Christian truth and life.
But more enduring than marble will abide the blessed
results which he and his colabourers have wrought
in the thought and life of the more than 2,000 graduates
who have been educated by them. Of these there
are 1,800 who represent the Hindus of thought and
culture in South India at present. Such is the influence
of one Christian school.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the work of the thousands of village Christian
schools is more humble in its aim it is much more
pervasive in its reach, and it marvellously directs
thought and inspires life in remote villages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twelve years ago I opened one little primary school
in a small unlettered heathen village. Ten bright
Hindu boys sought instruction at the hands of the
devout old Christian teacher placed there. Today
these boys have grown into manhood and, with one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or two exceptions, have entered into the Christian
life and have been formed into a Christian congregation.
They are not only intelligent, but firm and
beautiful in their new-found Christian hope. Moreover,
the whole village is permeated with Christian
truth and it resounds with the appeal of our faith. In
this way have come into existence many of the best
and strongest congregations of the Christian Church
in India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, to return to the educated class in India. We
have considered already its attitude of mind towards
the supplanting religion of Jesus.
</p>


  <p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">
    </p><div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 100%; text-align: center"><img src="images/026.png" width="700" height="216" alt="Madras Christian College." title="Madras Christian College." /><div class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">Madras Christian College.</div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their opposition to Christianity, as it is now presented
to them, I can appreciate. They are beginning,
for the first time, to think seriously and philosophically
about religion. They are, more than ever
before, impatient with their past, and annoyed with
the inadequacy of their present faith. It is not
strange if this feeling is shown in their attitude towards
the only supplanting faith. In this matter
they are on the way to light and truth. The under-current
is strongly right and in the direction of an
enlightened and an enlightening religion. They are
more earnestly in quest of truth than ever before.
Moreover it is not substantive Christianity, but adjectival
Christianity—the too Western type of our
faith—which arouses their antagonism. And I must
again express my belief that, before Christianity is
to gain universal acceptance by the people of India,
it must be dissociated from many Western ideas and
practices which seem to us essential even to its very
life. When we learn to forget our antecedents and
prejudices and to study well the Hindu mind and its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tendency, then perhaps shall we be prepared to present
a Christianity which will commend itself universally
to that land. The Rev. G. T. E. Slater in his
new book, wisely emphasized this same need.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The West,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“has to learn from the
East, and the East from the West. The questions
raised by the Vedanta will have to pass into Christianity
if the best minds of India are to embrace it;
and the Church of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘farther East’</span> will doubtless
contribute something to the thought of Christendom,
of the science of the soul, and of the omnipenetrativeness
and immanence of Deity.”</span><a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the most encouraging aspect of this question is
the present attitude of the mind of educated India
towards Christ himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Listen to the words of an orthodox Hindu in a
recent lecture delivered to his fellow Hindus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“How
can we,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“be blind to the greatness, the unrivalled
splendour of Jesus Christ. Behind the British
Empire and all European Powers lies the single
great personality—the greatest of all known to us—of
Jesus Christ. He lives in Europe and America, in
Asia and Africa as King and Guide and Teacher. He
lives in our midst. He seeks to revivify religion in
India. We owe everything, even this deep yearning
towards our own ancient Hinduism, to Christianity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All former antipathy to, and depreciation of Jesus,
our Lord, have given way to appreciation and admiration.
They vie with each other in a study of His
life and regard Him as the only perfect Exemplar of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man. That great land which has never found in its
old faith an ideal of life is now finding it in our
blessed Lord. This movement towards Him is remarkable.
They are enthroning Him in their imagination
and are drawing Him to their hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Braham friend of mine—a devout Hindu, a university
graduate, a barrister and a leader of the Hindu
community, requested me to purchase for him a
pocket copy of Thomas a Kempis' <span class="tei tei-q">“Imitation of
Christ.”</span> He possessed a large copy, but desired a
small one which he could carry with him and could
use for devotional purposes on his journeys. Some
of his friends sought other copies through him.
Thus they bought all the copies that I could find for
sale in South India. He also asked me to buy for him
a copy of Dr. Sheldon's book, <span class="tei tei-q">“In His Steps.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I bought four dozen copies and sold all to Brahmans
and to native Christians. One of our pastors
bought a copy. He soon handed it to a Brahman
friend—a government official and a university graduate—requesting
him to read it. This he did, and,
returning with the book a few days later, he earnestly
said—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, why don't you bring us more such books
as this. We also want to know more of Christ and
to follow <span class="tei tei-q">‘In His Steps.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, I find a wonderful eagerness among Hindus
of culture to know all that can be known about the
life and teaching of our Lord, even though they are
not prepared to accept his atonement as their salvation.
The same fact is true among the common people.
There are not a few who believe that the tenth—that
is, the coming—incarnation of Vishnu (Kalki
avatar) refers to Christ. A Hindu Saivite devotee
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
told me once that they proposed soon to place in
their monastery an image of Christ (as they had one
of Vishnu) and thus render to Him worship in common
with the others. I am confident that Hindus,
all but unanimously, would, today, vote to give him
a place in their pantheon and a share in their worship,
if Christians would accede to this. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did we
not,”</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“thus appropriate Buddha, the arch-enemy
of Brahmanism, twenty-five centuries ago,
and make him the ninth incarnation of Vishnu?
And why should we not regard Christ, also, as the
tenth <span class="tei tei-q">‘descent’</span> of our beloved Vishnu.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I deem this trend towards Christ, and it is marked
especially among the educated in all parts of India,
as the greatest encouragement to the Christian worker
in that land today.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I care not so much whether they accept our faith
in its Western form and spirit, so long as I see them
growing in their appreciation of, and devotion to the
Christ. Through Him I am sure they will pass on to
some outer expression or other of their faith in Him—an
expression which will doubtless correspond with
their own oriental turn of thought and life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Conclusion.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, whether we look at the growing Christian
community and its many cheering features of life and
of activity; or whether we study the non-Christian
community and all the social and national institutions
of that land, we find large encouragement and a rich
assurance of the speedy coming of the Kingdom of
our Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nearly a century ago—the very time in which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
America, through the America Board, sent its first
missionaries to that great land—the Directors of the
East India Company placed on record their sentiments
in the following words:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The sending of Christian missionaries to our
Eastern possessions is the maddest, most expensive,
most unwarranted project that was ever proposed by
a lunatic enthusiast.”</span> This was, at that time, the
conviction and the confession of the English rulers
of India. It was the voice of unbelief and the declaration
of defiant opposition. How different the
attitude and the words of Sir Rivers Thompson; the
Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, near the close of that
same century. <span class="tei tei-q">“In my judgment,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian
missionaries have done more real and lasting
good to the people of India than all other agencies
combined.”</span> Certainly, a no more competent witness
than he, and a no more conclusive evidence than his,
could be desired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In my compound in South India, for a quarter of a
century, a date palm tree grew and flourished. Years
later a seed was carried by a bird and dropped at the
foot of this palm tree. It was the seed of the sacred
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">boh</span></span> tree. It also sprouted and its slender, subtle
shoot wound round the sturdy palm. Every year it
grew higher until it finally towered above the date
palm; and the higher it grew the more its winding
stem thickened; and as it thickened it began to
tighten its grip upon the other tree. That grip,
so weak and innocent at first, soon became to the
palm tree a grip of death. For every day so added
to the encircling power of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">boh</span></span> tree that, about
three years ago, it completely enshrouded and killed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the palm. Today that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">boh</span></span> tree stands alone, indicating,
by its spiral form, where the unfortunate palm
found its death; and it stretches forth its beautiful
branches in rich verdure and in welcome shade to all
who seek refuge from the heat of the tropical sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is only a parable of the struggle which is witnessed
in India today. For many centuries the tree
of Brahmanism has flourished. It covers that whole
land. But at its very root has been sown the seed of
God's Word and there is growing out of it, in its
beauty and strength, the sacred tree of our Faith.
Already it has the old tree in its almighty grip. The
work of death is progressing and the final issue is
sure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it will not transpire in a day. The victory will
come, is now coming.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the resources of Hinduism are legion, and its
strange fascination, to some extent, continues.
India, which is increasingly becoming Christ's in
thought and ideals, will become his in worship and
ritual, when his name shall be heard in every home
throughout the land. But we need patience; and the
grand result to be achieved is worthy of the noblest
endurance and of the most patient waiting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christian workers in that great land are faithfully
labouring and hopefully waiting until the fruitful
branches of the sacred tree of Christianity shall have
spread over the whole land, so that its shade may be
the refuge of all souls in distress and its fruit shall
abound for the healing of all the nations of India.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The resources and the agencies of our Faith, which
are now utilized for the furtherance of the truth in
that land, are already wonderfully varied and potent;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but they are also increasing annually in prevailing
power as in bewildering variety. Every Christian
drawn from Hinduism and added to the fold of
Christ becomes, in himself, a force to draw and to
win others to Christ. This power has already become
the main agency in the growth of the church,
and its efficiency is to grow in geometric ratio as the
years increase.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great need of India today is the power of the
Holy Spirit of God. His people must bring themselves
much more into subjection to his Spirit, that
they may, the more fully, be the vehicles of His
grace to others and the channel of His power in the
land. The dangers of God's Church are, and will preëminently
be, dangers from within rather than from
without. It is Hinduism, godlessness and sin within
which must be fought with an eternal vigilance and
an uncompromising hostility. And for this a larger
baptism will mean a mighty fire of God kindled in
the whole Church such as will burn all its dross and
consume all opposition. And then shall we speedily
witness the great desire of our heart—a happy, prosperous
India, because it will be Emmanuel's land—a
part of the great Fold of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This consummation is as sure as God's own
promises, for, in all his work, the missionary is not
only encouraged by results achieved and by assurances
given, but also by the double promise of God.
First he has the promise of the Father to the Son:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ask of me and I will give to thee the heathen for
thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth

the possession of the earth; and in the confidence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his assurance he exclaims, <span class="tei tei-q">“All authority is given
unto me in heaven and in earth.”</span> And, to his waiting
disciples, he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore and make
disciples of all nations.”</span> And with this all-embracing
command he coupled the all-satisfying promise,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
world.”</span> Amen.

            obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the

            of life.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals and

            generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a

            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
